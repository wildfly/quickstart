Summary: The <code>bmt</code> quickstart demonstrates Bean-Managed Transactions (BMT), showing how to manually manage transaction demarcation while accessing JPA entities.<br />
Target Product: WildFly<br />
Source: <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/">https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/</a></p>
<h2><a href="#what-is-it" id="what-is-it">What is it?</a></h2>
<p>The <code>bmt</code> quickstart demonstrates how to manually manage transaction demarcation while accessing JPA entities in WildFly Application Server.</p>
<p>On occasion, the application developer requires finer grained control over the lifecycle of JTA transactions and JPA Entity Managers than the defaults provided by the Java EE container. This example shows how the developer can override these defaults and take control of aspects of the lifecycle of JPA and transactions.</p>
<p>When you run this example, you will be provided with a <code>Use bean managed Entity Managers</code> checkbox. * If you check the checkbox, it shows the developer responsibilities when injecting an Entity Manager into a managed (stateless) bean. * If you uncheck the checkbox, shows the developer responsibilities when using JPA and transactions with an unmanaged component.</p>
<p>WildFly ships with H2, an in-memory database written in Java. This example shows how to transactionally insert key value pairs into the H2 database and demonstrates the requirements on the developer with respect to the JPA Entity Manager.</p>
<p><em>Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with WildFly Application Server 11. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!</em></p>
<p><em>Note: This quickstart uses a <code>*-ds.xml</code> datasource configuration file for convenience and ease of database configuration. These files are deprecated in WildFly and should not be used in a production environment. Instead, you should configure the datasource using the Management CLI or Management Console. Datasource configuration is documented in the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/">Configuration Guide</a> for WildFly Application Server.</em></p>
<p><em>NOTE: A Java EE container is designed with robustness in mind, so you should carefully analyze the scalabiltiy, concurrency, and performance needs of your application before taking advantage of these techniques in your own applications.</em></p>
<h2><a href="#system-requirements" id="system-requirements">System Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on WildFly Application Server 11 or later.</p>
<p>All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.3.1 or later. See <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts">Configure Maven for WildFly 11</a> to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.</p>
<h2><a href="#use-of-wildfly-home" id="use-of-wildfly-home">Use of WILDFLY_HOME</a></h2>
<p>In the following instructions, replace <code>WILDFLY_HOME</code> with the actual path to your WildFly installation. The installation path is described in detail here: <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_WILDFLY_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables">Use of WILDFLY_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#start-the-server" id="start-the-server">Start the Server</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the WildFly directory.</li>
<li>The following shows the command line to start the server:
<pre><code>For Linux:   WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
For Windows: WILDFLY_HOME\bin\standalone.bat
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#build-and-deploy-the-quickstart" id="build-and-deploy-the-quickstart">Build and Deploy the Quickstart</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the WildFly server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li>Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
<pre><code>mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will deploy <code>target/bmt.war</code> to the running instance of the server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#access-the-application" id="access-the-application">Access the Application</a></h2>
<p>The application will be running at the following URL: <a href="http://localhost:8080/bmt/">http://localhost:8080/bmt/</a>.</p>
<p>You will be presented with a simple form for adding key/value pairs and a checkbox to indicate whether the updates should be executed using an unmanaged component. Effectively this will run the transaction and JPA updates in the servlet, not session beans. If the box is checked then the updates will be executed within a session bean method.</p>
<ol>
<li>To list all pairs leave the key input box empty.</li>
<li>To add or update the value of a key fill in the key and value input boxes.</li>
<li>Press the submit button to see the results.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a href="#undeploy-the-archive" id="undeploy-the-archive">Undeploy the Archive</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the WildFly server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li>When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:
<pre><code>mvn wildfly:undeploy
</code></pre>
</li>
