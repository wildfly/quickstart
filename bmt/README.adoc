[abstract]
The `bmt` quickstart demonstrates Bean-Managed Transactions (BMT), showing how to manually manage transaction demarcation while accessing JPA entities.

== What is it?

The `bmt` quickstart demonstrates how to manually manage transaction demarcation while accessing JPA entities in {productNameFull}.

On occasion, the application developer requires finer grained control over the lifecycle of JTA transactions and JPA Entity Managers than the defaults provided by the Java EE container. This example shows how the developer can override these defaults and take control of aspects of the lifecycle of JPA and transactions.

When you run this example, you are presented with a *Use bean managed Entity Managers* checkbox.

* If you check the checkbox, it shows the developer responsibilities when injecting an Entity Manager into a managed (stateless) bean.
* If you uncheck the checkbox, shows the developer responsibilities when using JPA and transactions with an unmanaged component.

{productName} ships with H2, an in-memory database written in Java. This example shows how to transactionally insert key value pairs into the H2 database and demonstrates the requirements on the developer with respect to the JPA Entity Manager.

== System Requirements

The application this project produces is designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

All you need to build this project is {buildRequirements}. See link:{configureMavenDocUrl}[Configure Maven to Build and Deploy the Quickstarts] to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

== Use of {jbossHomeName}

In the following instructions, replace `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the actual path to your {productName} installation. The installation path is described in detail here: link:{useProductHomeDocUrl}[Use of {jbossHomeName} and JBOSS_HOME Variables].

== Start the Server

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. Start the {productName} server with the default standalone profile by typing the following command.
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat` script.

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
+
----
$ mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
----

. This will deploy `target/{artifactId}.war` to the running instance of the server.

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/.

You will be presented with a simple form for adding key/value pairs and a checkbox to indicate whether the updates should be executed using an unmanaged component. Effectively this will run the transaction and JPA updates in the servlet, not session beans. If the box is checked then the updates will be executed within a session bean method.

. To list all pairs leave the key input box empty.
. To add or update the value of a key fill in the key and value input boxes.
. Click the *submit* button to see the results.

== Server Log: Expected Warnings and Errors

You will see the following warnings in the server log. You can ignore these warnings.

----
WFLYJCA0091: -ds.xml file deployments are deprecated. Support may be removed in a future version.

HHH000431: Unable to determine H2 database version, certain features may not work
----

== Undeploy the Archive

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:
+
----
$ mvn wildfly:undeploy
----

== Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a {productName} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:{useEclipseUrl}[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

----
$ mvn dependency:sources
