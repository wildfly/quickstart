<p>Author: Christian Sadilek<br />
Level: Intermediate<br />
Technologies: Asynchronous Servlet, CDI, EJB<br />
Summary: The <code>servlet-async</code> quickstart demonstrates how to use asynchronous servlets to detach long-running tasks and free up the request processing thread.<br />
Target Product: WildFly<br />
Source: <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/">https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/</a></p>
<h2><a href="#what-is-it" id="what-is-it">What is it?</a></h2>
<p>The <code>servlet-async</code> quickstart is a sample project showing the use of asynchronous servlets in WildFly Application Server.</p>
<p>It shows how to detach the execution of a long-running task from the request processing thread, so the thread is free to serve other client requests. The long-running tasks are executed using a dedicated thread pool and create the client response asynchronously.</p>
<p>A long-running task in this context does not refer to a computation intensive task executed on the same machine but could for example be contacting a third-party service that has limited resources or only allows for a limited number of concurrent connections. Moving the calls to this service into a separate and smaller sized thread pool ensures that less threads will be busy interacting with the long-running service and that more requests can be served that do not depend on this service.</p>
<h2><a href="#system-requirements" id="system-requirements">System Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on WildFly Application Server 11 or later.</p>
<p>All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.3.1 or later. See <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts">Configure Maven for WildFly 11</a> to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.</p>
<h2><a href="#use-of-wildfly-home" id="use-of-wildfly-home">Use of WILDFLY_HOME</a></h2>
<p>In the following instructions, replace <code>WILDFLY_HOME</code> with the actual path to your WildFly installation. The installation path is described in detail here: <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_WILDFLY_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables">Use of WILDFLY_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#start-the-server" id="start-the-server">Start the Server</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the WildFly directory.</li>
<li>The following shows the command line to start the server:
<pre><code>For Linux:   WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
For Windows: WILDFLY_HOME\bin\standalone.bat
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#build-and-deploy-the-quickstart" id="build-and-deploy-the-quickstart">Build and Deploy the Quickstart</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the WildFly server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li>Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
<pre><code>mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will deploy <code>target/servlet-async.war</code> to the running instance of the server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#access-the-application" id="access-the-application">Access the Application</a></h2>
<p>The application will be running at the following URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/servlet-async/">http://localhost:8080/servlet-async/</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#undeploy-the-archive" id="undeploy-the-archive">Undeploy the Archive</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the WildFly server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li>When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:
<pre><code>mvn wildfly:undeploy
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a WildFly server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts">Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#debug-the-application" id="debug-the-application">Debug the Application</a></h2>
<p>If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.</p>
<pre><code>    mvn dependency:sources
</code></pre>
