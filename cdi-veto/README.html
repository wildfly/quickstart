<p>Author: Jason Porter<br />
Level: Intermediate<br />
Technologies: CDI<br />
Summary: The <code>cdi-veto</code> quickstart is a simple CDI Portable Extension that uses SPI classes to show how to remove beans and inject JPA entities into an application.<br />
Target Product: WildFly<br />
Source: <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/">https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/</a></p>
<h2><a href="#what-is-it" id="what-is-it">What is it?</a></h2>
<p>The <code>cdi-veto</code> quickstart demonstrates a simple CDI portable extension and some of the SPI classes used to complete that task in an application deployed to WildFly Application Server. This particular extension explores the <code>ProcessInjectionTarget</code> and <code>InjectionTarget</code> SPI classes of CDI to demonstrate removing a bean from CDI's knowledge and correctly injecting JPA entities in your application.</p>
<p>A portable extension is an extension to Java EE 6 and above, which is tailored to a specific use case and will run on any Java EE 6 or later implementation. Portable extensions can implement features not yet supported by the specifications, such as type-safe messages or external configuration of beans.</p>
<p>The project contains very simple domain model classes, an extension class, the service provider configuration file, and an Arquillian test to verify the extension is working correctly.</p>
<p>This quickstart does not contain any user interface. The tests must be run to verify everything is working correctly.</p>
<p><em>Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with WildFly Application Server 11. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!</em></p>
<p><em>Note: This quickstart uses a <code>*-ds.xml</code> datasource configuration file for convenience and ease of database configuration. These files are deprecated in WildFly and should not be used in a production environment. Instead, you should configure the datasource using the Management CLI or Management Console. Datasource configuration is documented in the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/">Configuration Guide</a> for WildFly Application Server.</em></p>
<h2><a href="#system-requirements" id="system-requirements">System Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on WildFly Application Server 11 or later.</p>
<p>All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.3.1 or later. See <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts">Configure Maven for WildFly 11</a> to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.</p>
<h2><a href="#use-of-wildfly-home" id="use-of-wildfly-home">Use of WILDFLY_HOME</a></h2>
<p>In the following instructions, replace <code>WILDFLY_HOME</code> with the actual path to your WildFly installation. The installation path is described in detail here: <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_WILDFLY_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables">Use of WILDFLY_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#start-the-server" id="start-the-server">Start the Server</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the WildFly directory.</li>
<li>The following shows the command line to start the server:
<pre><code>For Linux:   WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
For Windows: WILDFLY_HOME\bin\standalone.bat
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#run-the-arquillian-tests" id="run-the-arquillian-tests">Run the Arquillian Tests</a></h2>
<p>This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the WildFly server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li>Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:
<pre><code>mvn clean verify -Parq-remote
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also let Arquillian manage the WildFly server by using the <code>arq-managed</code> profile. For more information about how to run the Arquillian tests, see <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/RUN_ARQUILLIAN_TESTS.md#run-the-arquillian-tests">Run the Arquillian Tests</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#investigate-the-console-output" id="investigate-the-console-output">Investigate the Console Output</a></h2>
<p>Maven prints summary of the 4 performed tests to the console.</p>

<p>In the server log you see a few lines similar to</p>
<pre><code>         INFO  [VetoExtension] (MSC service thread 1-8) Vetoed class class org.jboss.as.quickstart.cdi.veto.model.Car

<p>You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a WildFly server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts">Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts</a>.</p>
