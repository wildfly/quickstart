= {productName} Quickstarts

[toc]

[abstract]
The quickstarts demonstrate {javaVersion} and a few additional technologies from the {productNameFull} stack. They provide small, specific, working examples that can be used as a reference for your own project.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

These quickstarts run on the WildFly application server. The quickstarts are configured to use the correct Maven dependencies and ensure that you test and compile the quickstarts against the correct runtime environment.

Each quickstart folder contains a `README.adoc` file that describes the quickstart features and provides instructions about how to build and run it. Instructions are provided to build the more readable `README.html` files.

Make sure you read this entire document before you attempt to work with the quickstarts.

[[system_requirements]]
== System Requirements

The applications these projects produce are designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

All you need to build these projects is {buildRequirements}.

[[use_of_product_home_and_jboss_home_variables]]
== Use of WILDFLY_HOME and QUICKSTART_HOME Variables

The quickstart `README` files use the _replaceable_ value `__WILDFLY_HOME__` to denote the path to the WildFly server. When you encounter this value in a `README` file, make sure you replace it with the actual path to your WildFly server.

When you see the replaceable variable __QUICKSTART_HOME__, replace it with the path to the root directory of all of the quickstarts.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must perform the following tasks.

. xref:build_wildfly_server[Build the WildFly Server (Optional)]: This step is only required if you plan to run the latest https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly[development version of the WildFly server]. It is not required if you are running a https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/tags[tagged] or https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/releases[released] version of the WildFly server.

. xref:build_wildfly_boms[Build and Install the WildFly BOMs (Optional)]: This step is only required if you are building a development version of the WildFly server and see dependency issues when you build the quickstarts. It is not required if you are running a https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/tags[tagged] or  https://github.com/wildfly/boms/releases[released] version of the WildFly server.

. xref:build_quickstart_readme_files[Build the Quickstart README.html Files (Required)]: The quickstart `README` files are written in AsciiDoc to provide modular, reusable content; however, this makes them difficult to read. For this reason, you must also build the quickstart `README.html` files from the AsciiDoc source.

[[build_wildfly_server]]
=== Build the WildFly Server (Optional)

If you have downloaded a https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/tags[tagged] or https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/releases[released] version of the WildFly server, you can ignore this step. You can simply extract the WildFly server from the compressed file and https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/START_JBOSS_EAP.adoc#start-the-red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-server[start the server] from that directory.

If you plan to run the https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly[development version of the WildFly server], you must first download and build the WildFly server from source.

. If you have not yet done so, you must clone https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly[WildFly server] repository and navigate to it. You might also want to change the remote name from `origin` to `upstream` to be consistent with your other repositories.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:wildfly/wildfly.git
$ cd wildfly
$ git remote rename origin upstream
----
. Verify that your local `master` branch contains the latest updates.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git reset --hard upstream/master
----

. Build the WildFly server using the following command.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests -Denforcer.skip=true -Dcheckstyle.skip=true
----

. The WildFly server folder and ZIP files, which are named `wildfly-__VERSION__-SNAPSHOT` and `wildfly-__VERSION__-SNAPSHOT.ZIP` respectively,  are located in the `build/target/` directory. You can copy that folder or unzip the file to another location or https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/START_JBOSS_EAP.adoc#start-the-red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-server[start the server] from that directory.


[[build_wildfly_boms]]
=== Build and Install the WildFly BOMs (Optional)

If you have downloaded and are running a https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/tags[tagged] or https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/releases[released] version of the quickstarts, you can ignore this step because the required BOMs are already installed in Maven.

If you are using the latest https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart[development version] of the quickstarts and you are able to successfully build and deploy the quickstarts, you can also ignore this step because the required BOMS are already installed in Maven.

However, if you  are using the latest https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart[development version] of the quickstarts and you see build errors indicating missing dependencies, you must first xref:build_wildfly_server[build the latest WildFly server] and then build and install the WildFly BOMs. This installs the latest Maven artifacts that are required by the SNAPSHOT version of the WildFly quickstarts that are still under development.

. If you have not yet done so, clone https://github.com/wildfly/boms[WildFly BOMs] repository and navigate to it. You might also want to rename the directory to `wildfly-boms` to make it clear which BOMs it contains and also change the remote name from `origin` to `upstream` to be consistent with your other repositories.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:wildfly/boms.git
$ mv boms wildfly-boms
$ cd wildfly-boms
$ git remote rename origin upstream
----
. Verify that your local `master` branch contains the latest updates.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git reset --hard upstream/master
----

. Build the WildFly BOMs using the following command.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install
----
+
NOTE: If you run into build errors, check with the WildFly team to see if the repositories are temporarily out of sync.

. At this point, you can verify that all of the quickstarts build using the following command.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install '-Pdefault,!complex-dependencies'
----

[[build_quickstart_readme_files]]
=== Build the Quickstart README.html Files (Required)

The quickstart `README` files are written in AsciiDoc, not only because the language is much more powerful than Markdown, but also also because it is possible to extract common instructions into separate files to be reused across the quickstarts. While this makes them more flexible and easier to maintain, unfortunately, included files do not render in a readable format in GitHub or in most text editors.

The Maven plugin that is used to build and deploy the quickstarts can also generate fully rendered `README.html` instructions from the `README.adoc` files.

To build all of the quickstart `README.html` files, including the root `README.html` file that contains the table with links to all available quickstarts, navigate to the root folder of the quickstarts and run the following command.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package -Pdocs
----

[TIP]
====
To build the `README.html` file for a specific quickstart, navigate to the quickstart directory and run the above command.
====

If you see errors about missing dependencies, check the xref:prerequisites[prerequisites] section to determine whether you need to xref:build_wildfly_boms[build the WildFly BOMs] that corresponds to the version of the quickstarts that you are using.

[[suggested_approach_to_the_quickstarts]]
== Suggested Approach to the Quickstarts

We recommend that you approach the quickstarts as follows:

* Regardless of your level of expertise, we suggest you start with the `helloworld` quickstart. It is the simplest example and is an easy way to prove the server is configured and running correctly.
* If you are a beginner or new to JBoss, start with the quickstarts labeled `Beginner`, then try those marked as `Intermediate`. When you are comfortable with those, move on to the `Advanced` quickstarts.
* Some quickstarts are based upon other quickstarts but have expanded capabilities and functionality. If a prerequisite quickstart is listed, make sure you deploy and test it before looking at the expanded version.

The root folder of each individual quickstart contains a `README.html` file with detailed instructions on how to build and run the example.

// END ifndef::ProductRelease,EAPCDRelease,EAPXPRelease[]

//**********************************************************************************
//
// WildFly Developers: You can ignore the rest of this file.

[abstract]
The quickstarts demonstrate {javaVersion} and a few additional technologies from the {productNameFull} stack. They provide small, specific, working examples that can be used as a reference for your own project.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

These quickstarts run on {productNameFull} {productVersion}. Each quickstart folder contains a `README{outfilesuffix}` file that describes the quickstart features and provides instructions about how to build and run it.

We recommend that you use the *{quickstartDownloadName}* ZIP file, which you can download from the {quickstartDownloadUrl}[{productName} Software Download] page on the Red Hat Customer Portal. This version of the quickstarts uses the correct dependencies and ensures that you test and compile against the correct server runtime environment.

Each quickstart folder contains a `README{outfilesuffix}` file that describes the quickstart features and provides instructions about how to build and run it.

Make sure you read this entire document before you attempt to work with the quickstarts.

// System Requirements are not needed for the CD Releases, only for the Product and XP Release.
[[system_requirements]]
== System Requirements

The applications these projects produce are designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

All you need to build these projects is {buildRequirements}.

[[use_of_product_home_and_jboss_home_variables]]
== Use of {jbossHomeName} and QUICKSTART_HOME Variables

The quickstart `README` files use the _replaceable_ value `__{jbossHomeName}__`  to denote the path to the {productName} installation. When you encounter this value in a `README` file, make sure you replace it with the actual path to your {productName} installation. The installation path is described in detail here: link:{useProductHomeDocUrl}[Use of __{jbossHomeName}__ and __JBOSS_HOME__ Variables]

When you see the replaceable variable __QUICKSTART_HOME__, replace it with the path to the root directory of all of the quickstarts.

[[available_quickstarts]]
== Table of Available Quickstarts

The sources for all available quickstarts, which are listed in the following table, can be found here: {githubRepoUrl}.

Each quickstart provides the list of technologies demonstrated by the quickstart and the required experience level needed to build and deploy it. Click on the quickstart link in the table to see more detailed information about how to run it. Some quickstarts require deployment of other quickstarts. This information is noted in the `Prerequisites` section of the quickstart `README.html` file.

NOTE: Some of these quickstarts use the H2 database included with WildFly. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!
