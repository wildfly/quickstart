== Install the Quickstart Parent Artifact in Maven

This quickstart requires the `quickstart-parent` artifact to be installed in your local Maven repository. To install it, navigate to your __QUICKSTART_HOME__ directory  directory and run the following command.

[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ cd __QUICKSTART_HOME__
$ mvn clean install

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
+
----
$ mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
----

. This will deploy `service/target/{artifactId}-service.war` to the running instance of the server.

== Access the Application

You can check that the Web Service is running and deployed correctly by accessing the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/EJB3Bean?wsdl. This URL will display the deployed WSDL endpoint for the Web Service.

== Run the Client

. Make sure you xref:install_the_quickstart_parent_artifact_in_maven[Install the Quickstart Parent Artifact in Maven].

. Verify that the service is deployed properly.

== Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a {productName} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:{useEclipseUrl}[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].

For this quickstart, follow the special instructions to link:{useEclipseDeployJavaClientDocUrl}[Deploy and Undeploy a Quickstart Containing Server and Java Client Projects]

. To build all of the artifacts, right-click on the *{artifactId}* parent project, and choose *Run As* –> *Maven install*.
. To deploy the service:
** Right-click on the *{artifactId}-service* subproject, and choose *Run As* –> *Run on Server*.
** Choose the server and click *Finish*.
** This starts the server and deploys the service to the server.
