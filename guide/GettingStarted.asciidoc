Getting started with WildFly
============================
:Author: Pete Muir

[[GettingStarted-]]

To run the quickstarts with the provided build scripts, you'll need:

[TIP]
========================================================================
If you already have any of these pieces of software, there is no need to
install them again!
========================================================================

Java 8, to run WildFly and Maven::
  Choose your Java runtime, and follow their installation instructions. For example, you could choose one of:

  * link:http://openjdk.java.net/install/[OpenJDK]
  * link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/index-137561.html[Oracle Java SE]
  
Maven 3, to build and deploy the quickstarts::
  Follow the official Maven installation guide if you don't already have Maven 3 installed. You can check which version of Maven you have installed (if any) by running `mvn --version` . If you see a version newer than 3.0.0, you are ready to go.

The JBoss WildFly runtime::
  Download JBoss WildFly from the link:http://wildfly.org/downloads/[WildFly download page]
The WildFly quickstarts::
  Available from link:https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart[WildFly Quickstarts]

If you wish to use the examples from an IDE, we recommend using CodeReady Studio, or Eclipse with JBoss Tools.

Red Hat CodeReady Studio::
  Download CodeReady Studio from link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/download[].
Eclipse, with JBoss Tools::
  Download JBoss Tools from link:http://jboss.org/tools[]. Make sure you install m2eclipse as well.

[TIP]
========================================================================
JBoss WildFly offer the
ability to manage multiple AS instances from a single control point.
A collection of such servers are referred to as members of a "domain",
with a single Domain Controller process acting as the management control
point. Domains can span multiple physical (or virtual) machines, with
all AS instances on a given host under the control of a Host Controller
process. The Host Controllers interact with the Domain Controller to
control the lifecycle of the AS instances running on that host and to
assist the Domain Controller in managing them.

JBoss WildFly also offers a standalone mode, which is perfect for a single
server. We use this throughout the quickstarts.
========================================================================


Installing and starting the JBoss server on Linux, Unix or Mac OS X
-------------------------------------------------------------------
[[GettingStarted-on_linux]]

First, let's verify that both Java and Maven are correctly
installed. In a console, type:

    java -version

You should see a version string (at least `1.8.0`) printed. If not, contact your provider of Java for assistance. Next, type:

    mvn --version

You should see a version string (at least `3.3.0`) printed. If not, contact the Maven community for assistance.

Next, we need to choose a location for WildFly to live. By default, WildFly will be extracted into `wildfly-11.x.x.x` (where `11.x.x.x` matches the version you downloaded):

    unzip wildfly-11.x.x.x.zip

Now, let's start WildFly in standalone mode:

    wildfly-11.x.x.x/bin/standalone.sh


[TIP]
========================================================================
If you want to stop WildFly, simply press Crtl-C whilst the terminal
has focus.
========================================================================

That's it, WildFly is installed and running! Visit http://localhost:8080/ to check the server has started properly.


[TIP]
========================================================================
You can find the server log for standalone instances in
`wildfly-11.x.x.x/standalone/log/server.log`. The
link:http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/7/html/Administration_and_Configuration_Guide/index.html[Administration and Configuration Guide for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7] or the
link:https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Getting+Started+Guide[Getting Started Guide for JBoss WildFly]
covers more on configuring logging.
========================================================================


Installing and starting the JBoss server on Windows
---------------------------------------------------
[[GettingStarted-on_windows]]


First, let's verify that both Java and Maven are correctly installed. In a Command Prompt, type:

    java -version

You should see a version string (at least `1.8.0`) printed. If not, contact your provider of Java for assistance. Next, type:

    mvn --version

You should see a version string (at least `3.3.0`) printed. If not, contact the Maven community for assistance.

Next, we need to choose a location for JBoss WildFly to live. By default, JBoss WildFly will be extracted into `wildfly-11.x.x.x` (where `11.x.x.x` matches the version you downloaded). Unzip JBoss Enterprise Application Platform or JBoss WildFly using your tool of choice.

Finally, let's start JBoss WildFly in standalone mode. Locate your installation and run `standalone.bat` located in `bin`.


[TIP]
========================================================================
If you want to stop the server, simply press Crtl-C whilst the terminal
has focus.
========================================================================

That's it, JBoss WildFly is installed and running! Visit http://localhost:8080/ to check the server has started properly.


[TIP]
========================================================================
You can find the server log for standalone instances in
`wildfly-11.x.x.x/standalone/log/server.log`. The
link:http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/7/html/Administration_and_Configuration_Guide/index.html[Administration and Configuration Guide for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7] or the

covers more on configuring logging.
========================================================================


Starting the JBoss server from CodeReady Studio or Eclipse with JBoss Tools
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[[GettingStarted-with_jboss_tools]]

You may choose to use CodeReady Studio, or Eclipse with JBoss Tools, rather than the command line to run JBoss WildFly, and to deploy the quickstarts. If you don't wish to use Eclipse, you should skip this section.

Make sure you have installed and started CodeReady Studio or Eclipse. First, we need to add our WildFly instance to it. First, navigate to _Preferences_:

image:gfx/Eclipse_Detect_Servers_1.png[]

Now, locate the _JBoss Tools Runtime Detection_ preferences:

image:gfx/Eclipse_Detect_Servers_2.png[]

Click _Add_ and locate where you put servers on your disk:

image:gfx/Eclipse_Detect_Servers_3.png[]

Any available servers will be located, now all you need to do is click _OK_, and then _OK_ on the preferences dialog:

image:gfx/Eclipse_Detect_Servers_4.png[]

Now, let's start the server from Eclipse. If you previously started a server from the command line, you should stop it there first.

First, we need to make sure the Server tab is on view. Open the _Window -> Show View -> Other..._ dialog:

image:gfx/Eclipse_Server_Tab_1.jpg[]

And select the Server view:

image:gfx/Eclipse_Server_Tab_2.jpg[]

You should see the Server View appear with the detected servers:

image:gfx/Eclipse_Server_Tab_3.jpg[]

Now, we can start the server. Right click on the server in the Server view, and select Start :

image:gfx/Eclipse_Server_Start_1.jpg[]

[TIP]
========================================================================
If you want to debug your application, you can simply select Debug
rather than Start . This will start the server in debug mode, and
automatically attach the Eclipse debugger.
========================================================================

You'll see the server output in the Console :

image:gfx/Eclipse_Server_Start_2.jpg[]

That's it, we now have the server up and running in Eclipse!


Importing the quickstarts into Eclipse
--------------------------------------
[[GettingStarted-importing_quickstarts_into_eclipse]]

In order to import the quickstarts into Eclipse, you will need m2eclipse installed. If you have CodeReady Studio, then m2eclipse is already installed.

First, choose _File -> Import..._:

image:gfx/Import_Quickstarts_1.jpg[]

Select _Existing Maven Projects_:

image:gfx/Import_Quickstarts_2.jpg[]

Click on _Browse_, and navigate to the `quickstarts/` directory:

image:gfx/Import_Quickstarts_3.jpg[]

Finally, make sure all 4 quickstarts are found and selected, and click _Finish_:

image:gfx/Import_Quickstarts_4.jpg[]

Eclipse should now successfully import 4 projects:

image:gfx/Import_Quickstarts_5.jpg[]

It will take a short time to import the projects, as Maven needs to download the project's dependencies from remote repositories.


Managing JBoss WildFly
----------------------

Here we will quickly outline how you can access both the command line interface and the web management interface for managing JBoss WildFly. Detailed information for both can be found in the link:http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6/html/Administration_and_Configuration_Guide/index.html[Administration and Configuration Guide for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6] or the link:https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY/Admin+Guide[Admin Guide for JBoss WildFly].

When the server is running, the web management interface can be accessed at http://localhost:9990/console. You can use the web management interface to create datasources, manage deployments and configure the server.

JBoss WildFly also comes with a command line interface. To run it on Linux, Unix or Mac, execute:

    wildfly-11.x.x.x/bin/jboss-admin.sh --connect

Or, on Windows:

    wildfly-11.x.x.x/bin/jboss-admin.bat --connect

Once started, type help to discover the commands available to you.

Throughout this guide we use the `wildfly` maven plugin to deploy and undeploy applications. This plugin uses the Native Java Detyped Management API to communicate with the server. The Detyped API is used by management tools to control an entire domain of servers, and exposes only a small number of types, allowing for backwards and forwards compatibility.
