= jaxrs-jwt: JAX-RS secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)

[abstract]
The `jaxrs-jwt` quickstart demonstrates a JAX-RS secured application using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with Elytron.

:standalone-server-type: default
:archiveType: war
:includes-cli-scripts:

== What is it?

This quickstart demonstrates how to secure a JAX-RS service with JWTs using the Elytron subsystem.

There are 4 resource endpoints, plus another one for generating JWTs.

* `/rest/public` - Requires no authentication.
* `/rest/customer` - Can be accessed by users with `customer` role authority.
* `/rest/admin` - Can be accessed by users with `admin` role authority.
* `/rest/claims` - Can be accessed by any authenticated user and demonstrates how to extract token claims.
* `/rest/token` - `POST` endpoint for generating tokens from provided credentials.

NOTE: This quickstart asserts only few JWT claims for demonstration purposes. In your application, you should use all claims required by the specification you are using.

[[generate_an_rs256_key_pair]]
== Generate an RS256 Key Pair

Elytron uses RS256 (SHA256withRSA), RS384 (SHA384withRSA), and RS512 (SHA512withRSA) asymmetric keys for signing JWTs. The keys must be in PKCS#8 format.

You can generate your own RS256 key pair using java keytool.

. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory that contains the {productName} standalone server configuration, which is defined by the `jboss.server.config.dir` system property.

. Create a keystore for your server using the following command:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$>keytool -genkey -alias alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore jwt.keystore -storepass secret -keypass secret

[[configure_the_server]]
== Configure the Server

You configure the security domain by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-elytron.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

. Before you begin, make sure you do the following:

* xref:back_up_standalone_server_configuration[Back up the {productName} standalone server configuration] as described above.
* xref:start_the_eap_standalone_server[Start the {productName} server with the standalone default profile] as described above.

. Review the `configure-elytron.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script adds the configuration that enables Elytron security for the quickstart deployment. Comments in the script describe the purpose of each block of commands.
+
IMPORTANT: This script contains placeholder PEM public key to make the deployment of this quickstart easy. DO _not_ use this key for anything but testing purposes! You must generate your own key pair for your own application.

. Open a new terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the path to your server:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-elytron.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.
+

. Because this example quickstart demonstrates security, system exceptions are thrown when secured EJB access is attempted by an invalid user. If you want to review the security exceptions in the server log, you can skip this step. If you want to suppress these exceptions in the server log, run the following command, replacing `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the path to your server:
[[suppress_system_exceptions]]
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-system-exception.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows,use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.
+

You should see the following result when you run the script:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
The batch executed successfully
----

. Stop the {productName} server.

== Review the Modified Server Configuration

After stopping the server, open the `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file and review the changes.

. The following `token-realm` was added to the `security-realms` element in the `elytron` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<token-realm name="jwt-realm" principal-claim="sub">
    <jwt issuer="quickstart-jwt-issuer" audience="jwt-audience" key-store="jwt-key-store" certificate="alias"/>
</token-realm>
----
. The following `security-domain` was added, which uses the `jwt-realm`.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<security-domain name="jwt-domain" default-realm="jwt-realm" permission-mapper="default-permission-mapper">
    <realm name="jwt-realm" role-decoder="groups-to-roles"/>
</security-domain>
----

. The following HTTP authentication factory was added, which uses `BEARER_TOKEN` and the `jwt-realm`.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<http-authentication-factory name="jwt-http-authentication" http-server-mechanism-factory="global" security-domain="jwt-domain">
    <mechanism-configuration>
        <mechanism mechanism-name="BEARER_TOKEN">
            <mechanism-realm realm-name="jwt-realm"/>
        </mechanism>
    </mechanism-configuration>
</http-authentication-factory>
----

. Finally, the application security domain is configured in Undertow to use the new HTTP authentication factory.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----

<application-security-domains>
    <application-security-domain name="other" http-authentication-factory="jwt-http-authentication"/>
</application-security-domains>

[[access_the_application]]
== Access the Application

Before you run the client, make sure you have already successfully deployed the REST to the server in the previous step and that your terminal is still in the same folder.

Type the following command to execute the client.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn exec:java
----

== Investigate the Console Output

When you run the `mvn exec:java` command, you see the following output.

The client tries to test service functionality using 3 identities.

1. `admin` - this user belongs to group `admin`, which gives him
rights to access `/rest/protected`
2. `customer` - this user belongs to group `customer`, which gives him rights to access `/rest/customer`
3. no credentials provided - the client tries to access all endpoints, but can only access unprotected `/rest/public`

The endpoint `/rest/claims` demonstrates a way, how you could extract token claims for further manipulation.
