/**
 * <p>
 * Operations with cached list of tasks for current user.

 *
 * <p>
 * Delegates to {@link TaskDao} for persistence operations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This bean ensures that task list will be obtained at most once per request or additionally after each invalidation (
 * {@link #invalidate()}).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This behavior prevents unnecessary delegations to the persistence layer, since {{@link #getAll()} can be called several times
 * per request when used in view layer.
