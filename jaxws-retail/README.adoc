The `jaxws-retail` quickstart is a working example of a simple web service endpoint.

:standalone-server-type: default
:archiveType: jar
// Override the archive directory
:archiveDir: {artifactId}/service/target
// Override the archive name
:archiveName: {artifactId}-service

== What is it?

The `jaxws-retail` quickstart demonstrates the use of _JAX-WS_ in {productNameFull} as a simple profile management application. It also demonstrates usage of wsconsume to generate classes from WSDL file.

== Run the Client

. Make sure you xref:install_the_quickstart_parent_artifact_in_maven[Install the Quickstart Parent Artifact in Maven].

. Verify that the service is deployed properly.

. Open a terminal and navigate into the client directory of this quickstart.

This quickstart is dependent on a WSDL file that is included in the `{artifactId}-service` project, so it deploys and runs differently in {JBDSProductName} than the other quickstarts.

[NOTE]
====
When you import this project into {JBDSProductName}, you see 17 errors. These `Java Problems` are because these classes are not included in this project. Instead, they are defined in and generated from the `{artifactId}-service/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wsdl/ProfileMgmtService.wsdl` WSDL file. You can ignore these errors.

You will also see the following warning:
[source]
----
WS-I: A problem occured while running the WS-I WSDL conformance check: org.eclipse.wst.wsi.internal.analyzer.WSIAnalyzerException: The WS-I Test Assertion Document (TAD)document was either not found or could not be processed.The WSDLAnalyzer was unable to validate the given WSDL File.
----
This is a known Eclipse issue. For more information, see Eclipse Bugzilla - https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=535813[Bug 535813].
