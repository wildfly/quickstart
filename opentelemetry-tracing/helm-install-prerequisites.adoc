=== Install OpenTelemetry Collector on OpenShift

The functionality of this quickstart depends on a running instance of the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/[OpenTelemetry Collector].

To deploy and configure the OpenTelemetry Collector, you will need to apply a set of configurations to your OpenShift cluster, to configure the OpenTelemetry Collector as well as any external routes needed:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
include::charts/opentelemetry-collector.yaml[]
----

To make things simpler, you can find these commands in `charts/opentelemetry-collector.yaml`, and to apply them run the following command in your terminal:

[source]
----
$ oc apply -f charts/opentelemetry-collector.yaml
----
