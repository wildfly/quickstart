[abstract]
The `opentelemetry-tracing` quickstart demonstrates the use of the OpenTelemetry tracing specification in {productName}.

== What is it?

OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed for the creation and management of
telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. OpenTelemetry support in {productName} is limited to traces only.
{productName}'s support of OpenTelemetry provides out of the box tracing of Jakarta REST calls, as well as
container-managed Jakarta REST Client invocations. Additionally, applications can have injected a `Tracer` instance
in order to create and manage custom `Span`s as a given application may require. These traces are exported
to an OpenTelemetry Collector instance listening on the same host.

== Architecture

In this quickstart, we have a collection of CDI beans and REST endpoints that  expose functionalities of the OpenTelemetry support in {productName}.

// Use of {jbossHomeName}
include::../shared-doc/use-of-jboss-home-name.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need:

* less than 15 minutes
* JDK 11+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven 3.5.3+
* Docker Compose, or alternatively Podman Compose

include::../shared-doc/use-of-jboss-home-name.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Steps

// Start the {productName} Standalone Server
include::../shared-doc/start-the-standalone-server.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[[configure_the_server]]
=== Configure the Server

You enable OpenTelemetry by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-opentelemtry.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

. Before you begin, make sure you do the following:

* xref:back_up_standalone_server_configuration[Back up the {productName} standalone server configuration] as described above.
* xref:start_the_eap_standalone_server[Start the {productName} server with the standalone default profile] as described above.

. Review the `configure-opentelemtry.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script adds the configuration that enables OpenTelemetry for the quickstart components. Comments in the script describe the purpose of each block of commands.
. Open a new terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the path to your server:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-opentelemetry.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.
+

You should see the following result when you run the script:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
The batch executed successfully
process-state: reload-required
----

. You'll need to reload the configuration after that:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --commands=reload
----

[[start_opentelemetry_collector]]
=== Starting the OpenTelemetry Collector

By default, {productName} will publish traces every 10 seconds, so you will soon start seeing errors about a refused connection.

This is because we told {productName} to publish to a server that is not there, so we need to fix that. To make that as simple as possible, you can use Docker Compose to start an instance of the OpenTelemetry Collector.

The Docker Compose configuration file is `docker-compose.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
include::docker-compose.yaml[]
----

The Collector server configuration file is `otel-collector-config.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
include::otel-collector-config.yaml[]
----

We can now bring up the collector instance:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker-compose up
----

The service should be available almost immediately, which you can verify by looking for the log entry `Everything is ready. Begin running and processing data.`.

[NOTE]
====
You may use Podman as alternative to Docker if you prefer, in such case the command should be `podman-compose up`.
====

[NOTE]
====
If your environment does not support Docker or Podman, please refer to
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation[Otel Collector documentation] for alternatives on how to install
and run the OpenTelemetry Collector.
====

[NOTE]
=====
Part of the value of OpenTelemetry is its vendor-agnostic approach to exporting its various supported signals. As such,
this demo will only log the incoming traces, leaving the relaying of those signals to a downstream aggregation platform
as an exercise for the reader.
=====

Now we can start adding our custom spans from our application.

=== Creating traces

==== Implicit tracing of REST resources

The OpenTelemetry support in {productName} provides an implicit tracing of all Jakarta REST resources. That means that
for all applications, {productName} will automatically:

* extract the Span context from the incoming Jakarta REST request
* start a new Span on incoming Jakarta REST request and close it when the request is completed
* inject Span context to any outgoing Jakarta REST request
* start a Span for any outgoing Jakarta REST request and finish the Span when the request is completed

==== Explicit tracing

The OpenTelemetry API also supports explicit tracing should your application required it:

[source,java]
-----
include::src/main/java/org/wildfly/quickstarts/opentelemetry/ExplicitlyTracedBean.java[]
-----

include::../shared-doc/build-and-deploy-the-quickstart.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Access the quickstart application

You can either access the application via your browser at http://localhost:8080/opentelemetry-tracing/implicit-trace[], or http://localhost:8080/opentelemetry-tracing/explicit-trace[]. You can also access it from the command line:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/opentelemetry-tracing/implicit-trace
$ curl http://localhost:8080/opentelemetry-tracing/explicit-trace
----

Either endpoint should return a simple document:

[source]
-----
hello
-----

=== View the traces

You can view the traces by looking at the Collector's log. You should see something like this:

== Conclusion

OpenTelemetry Tracing provides the mechanisms for your application to participate
in the distributed tracing with minimal effort on the application side. The Jakarta REST
resources are always traced by default, but the specification allows you to create
individual spans directly with the CDI injection of the `io.opentelemetry.api.trace.Tracer`.
