[abstract]
The `cmt` quickstart demonstrates Container-Managed Transactions (CMT), showing how to use transactions managed by the container.

== What is it?

The `cmt` quickstart demonstrates how to use container-managed transactions (CMT), which are transactions managed by the container in {productNameFull}. It is a fairly typical scenario of updating a database and sending a JMS message in the same transaction. A simple MDB is provided that prints out the message sent but this is not a transactional MDB and is purely provided for debugging purposes.

Aspects touched upon in the code:

* XA transaction control using the container managed transaction annotations
* XA access to the standard default datasource using the JPA API
* XA access to a JMS queue

After you complete this quickstart, you are invited to run through the following quickstarts:

* link:../jts/README{outfilesuffix}[jts] - The `jts` quickstart builds upon this quickstart by distributing the `CustomerManager` and `InvoiceManager`.
* link:../jts-distributed-crash-rec/README{outfilesuffix}[jts-distributed-crash-rec] - The crash recovery quickstart builds upon the link:../jts/README{outfilesuffix}[jts] quickstart by demonstrating the fault tolerance of {productName}.

=== What are Container Managed Transactions?

Prior to EJB, getting the right incantation to ensure sound transactional operation of the business logic was a highly specialized skill. Although this still holds true to a great extent, EJB has provided a series of improvements to allow simplified transaction demarcation notation that is therefore easier to read and test.

With CMT, the EJB container sets the boundaries of a transaction. This differs from BMT (bean-managed transactions), where the developer is responsible for initiating and completing a transaction using the `begin`, `commit`, and `rollback` methods on a `jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction`.

=== What Makes This an Example of Container Managed Transactions?

Take a look at `org.jboss.as.quickstarts.cmt.ejb.CustomerManagerEJB`. You can see that this stateless session bean has been marked up with the `@jakarta.ejb.TransactionAttribute` annotation.

The following options are available for this annotation.

Required:: As demonstrated in the quickstart. If a transaction does not already exist, this will initiate a transaction and complete it for you, otherwise the business logic will be integrated into the existing transaction.
RequiresNew:: If there is already a transaction running, it will be suspended, the work performed within a new transaction which is completed at exit of the method and then the original transaction resumed.
Mandatory:: If there is no transaction running, calling a business method with this annotation will result in an error.
NotSupported:: If there is a transaction running, it will be suspended and no transaction will be initiated for this business method.
Supports:: This will run the method within a transaction if a transaction exists, alternatively, if there is no transaction running, the method will not be executed within the scope of a transaction.
Never:: If the client has a transaction running and does not suspend it but calls a method annotated with Never then an EJB exception will be raised.

=== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/

You are presented with a simple form for adding customers to a database.

After a customer is successfully added to the database, a message is produced containing the details of the customer. An example MDB dequeues this message and print the following contents.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
Received Message: Created invoice for customer named:  Jack
----

If an existing customer name is provided, no JMS message is sent. Instead of the above message, a duplicate warning is displayed.

The customer name should match: letter &amp; '-', otherwise an error is given. This is to show that a `LogMessage` entity is still stored in the database. That is because the `logCreateCustomer` method in the `LogMessageManagerEJB` EJB is decorated with the `@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW)` annotation.

=== Server Log: Expected Warnings and Errors

You will see the following warnings in the server log. You can ignore these warnings.
