websocket-endpoint: Web application using WebSockets and JSON-P
================================================================
Author: Rafael Benevides  
Level: Beginner  
Technologies: CDI, WebSocket, JSON-P  
Summary: Shows how to use WebSockets with JSON to broadcast information to all open WebSocket sessions in WildFly.  
Target Product: WildFly    
Source: <https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/>   


What is it?
-----------

The `websocket-endpoint` quickstart demonstrates how to use Java API for WebSockets to create server endpoints in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. 

The `BidWebSocketEndpoint` provides the WebSocket endpoint that receives `Message` instances from clients/browsers and replies with the current `Bidding` instance. The conversion from JSON content to the specific instances are made by `MessageDecoder` and `BiddingEncode` classes.

Every update made on the `Bidding` are immediately propagated to all opened WebSocket sessions without any browser submission or AJAX polling mechanism.


System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7 or later. 

All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.1.1 or later. See [Configure Maven for WildFly 7](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.


Use of WILDFLY_HOME
---------------

In the following instructions, replace `WILDFLY_HOME` with the actual path to your WildFly installation. The installation path is described in detail here: [Use of WILDFLY_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP7_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables).



Start the WildFly Server
-------------------------

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the  WildFly directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server with the default profile:

        For Linux:   WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: WILDFLY_HOME\bin\standalone.bat


Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------

1. Make sure you have started the WildFly server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn package wildfly:deploy
4. This will deploy `target/wildfly-websocket-endpoint.war` to the running instance of the server.
 


Access the application
---------------------

Access the running application in a browser at the following URL:  <http://localhost:8080/wildfly-websocket-endpoint/>

You're presented with a simple form that shows a bidding with the status `NOT_STARTED`. 

Click on `Do a bid!` button. That will start the bidding and trigger the 1 minute countdown timer. You can also notice that every Bid will be listed under the "List of bids" section.

You should open the application URL in other browsers or tabs. You will notice that every change on the bidding is automatically update in all opened browser or tabs. The item will be SOLD once that it reaches the "Buy now price". At the countdown timeout, the bidding will be EXPIRED. You can click on `Buy it now` button to immediately buy the item.

You can restart the bidding if you click on `Reset bidding` button.


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

1. Make sure you have started the WildFly server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn wildfly:undeploy


Run the Quickstart in JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------


You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For more information, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) 


Debug the Application
------------------------------------

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

    mvn dependency:sources
   

<!-- Build and Deploy the Quickstart to OpenShift - Coming soon! -->
