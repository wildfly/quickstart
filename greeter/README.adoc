The `greeter` quickstart demonstrates the use of CDI, JPA, JTA, EJB and JSF in {productName}.

== What is it?

The `greeter` quickstart demonstrates the use of CDI, JPA, JTA, EJB and JSF in {productNameFull}.

When you deploy this example, two users are automatically created for you: `emuster` and `jdoe`. This data is located in the `src/main/resources/import.sql file`.

To test this example:

. Enter a name in the *username* field and click on *Greet!*.
. If you enter a username that is not in the database, you get a message `No such user exists!`.
. If you enter a valid username, you get a message `Hello,` followed by the user's first and last name.
. To create a new user, click the *Add a new user* link. Enter the *username*, *first name*, and *last name*, and then click *Add User*. The user is added and a message displays the new user id number.
. Click on the `Greet a user!` link to return to the `Greet!` page.
