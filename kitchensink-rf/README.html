<p>Author: Pete Muir</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">What is it?</h2>

<p>This is your project! It is a sample, deployable Maven 3 project to help you get your foot in the door developing with Java EE 6 on JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7. </p>

<p>This project is setup to allow you to create a compliant Java EE 6 application using JSF 2.0, CDI 1.0, EJB 3.1, JPA 2.0 and Bean Validation 1.0. It includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence and transaction code to introduce you to database access in enterprise Java. </p>

<p>This application builds on top of the standard JSF approach by incorporating the RichFaces project to provide a set of components, allowing for a rich user experience.  RichFaces builds on top of the JSF standard and is a fully portable solution compatible with all JSF implementations.</p>

<p>The <code>kitchensink</code> quickstart is built using vanilla JSF for its front end. The <code>kitchensink-rf</code> quickstart builds on top of the JSF user interface, augmenting it with RichFaces JSF components and capabilities.  </p>

<p>Some key points to make note of while running the application:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ajax push: This application makes use of Ajax push. When a member is created in one browser, the member list is updated in <strong>all</strong> open browsers.</p>

<p>Try this yourself. Open two different browsers, create a new member in one browser and watch for the list to be updated in both browsers.</p></li>
<li><p>Ajax: All page updates are made with an Ajax call, increasing the page responsiveness and leading to a more native <strong>feeling</strong> application.</p></li>
<li><p>Client-side validation: By simply nesting a <code>&lt;rich:validator /&gt;</code> tag in the input elements, we wire them with RichFaces client-side validation capabilities. The inputs are validated locally using javascript, without requiring a round-trip to the server.</p></li>
<li><p>Popups: Click the <code>view</code> link next to a member in the member list to view a popup with the member details. To close the popup, click the <code>X</code> in the top right-hand corner, or click anywhere on the background mask.</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile support: View the application from a webkit powered browser on a mobile device to try out the mobile version of the application. Alternatively, view the mobile version on your desktop by navigating to the url:  <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-kitchensink-rf/mobile/">http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-kitchensink-rf/mobile/</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Specific changes to the "vanilla" kitchensink desktop view:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Ajax push: This application makes use of Ajax push. When a member is created in one browser, the member list is updated in <strong>all</strong> open browsers.</p></li>
    <li><p>rich:validator for client-side-validation</p></li>
    <li><p>a4j:commandButton to submit a form via ajax</p></li>
    <li><p>rich:collapsiblePanel around the members list - click to expand/collapse</p></li>
    <li><p>rich:popupPanel via the "view" link in the table for showing member details with a popup</p></li>
    <li><p>rich:panel to get a styled panel header</p></li>
    <li><p>rich:messages to get styled error messages (with icons)</p></li>
    <li><p>rich:dataTable for styled column headers</p></li>
    <li><p>activated the "classic" skin in the web.xml - (styles vanilla JSF components too)</p></li>
    <li><p>leveraged AS 7 modules for RF dependencies via the "Dependencies" manifest.mf entry</p></li>
</ul><p>Upgrades made to enable the mobile view:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>enabled resourceLoadingOptimisation (packaging and minification)</p></li>
    <li><p>introduced the RichFaces mobile compatibility CSS file</p></li>
    <li><p>device detection to automatically choose between the desktop and mobile templates</p></li>
    <li><p>split the app into multiple screens for mobile</p></li>
    <li><p>single page programming model w/ CSS3 page transitions activating the device GPU</p></li>
    <li><p>Note: mobile still has a4j:push integration</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_2">System requirements</h2>

<p>All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or better, Maven 3.0 or better.</p>

<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7. </p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Configure Maven</h2>

<p>If you have not yet done so, you must <a href="../README.html#mavenconfiguration">Configure Maven</a> before testing the quickstarts.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Start JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7 with the Web Profile</h2>

<ol>
<li>Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JBoss server directory.</li>
<li><p>The following shows the command line to start the server with the web profile:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">For</span> <span class="n">Linux</span><span class="p">:</span>   <span class="n">JBOSS_HOME</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">standalone</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span>
<span class="n">For</span> <span class="n">Windows</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">JBOSS_HOME</span><span class="o">\</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="o">\</span><span class="n">standalone</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">bat</span>
</pre>
</div></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_5">Build and Deploy the Quickstart</h2>

<p><em>NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See <a href="../README.html#buildanddeploy">Build and Deploy the Quickstarts</a> for complete instructions and additional options.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li><p>Type this command to build and deploy the archive:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">clean</span> <span class="n">package</span> <span class="n">jboss</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">as</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">deploy</span>
</pre>
</div></li>
<li><p>This will deploy <code>target/jboss-as-kitchensink-rf.war</code> to the running instance of the server.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_6">Access the application </h2>

<p>The application will be running at the following URL: <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-kitchensink-rf/">http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-kitchensink-rf/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">Undeploy the Archive</h2>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li><p>When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">jboss</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">as</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">undeploy</span>
</pre>
</div></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_8">Run the Arquillian Tests </h2>

<p>This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container. </p>

<p><em>NOTE: The following commands assume you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line.
