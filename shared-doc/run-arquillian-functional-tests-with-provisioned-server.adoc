= Run the Arquillian Functional Tests with a provisioned server
//******************************************************************************
// Include this template if your quickstart provides standard Arquillian
// functional tests.
//******************************************************************************

This quickstart provides Arquillian functional tests. They are located under the  `src/tests/` directory. Functional tests verify that your application behaves correctly from the user's point of view and simulate clicking around the web page as a normal user would do.

. Type the following command to run the `verify` goal with the `provisioned-server` profile activated.

[source,options="nowrap"]

$ mvn clean verify -Pprovisioned-server

This will build the provisioned server with the quickstart application, start it, run the functionnal tests and stop the server.
