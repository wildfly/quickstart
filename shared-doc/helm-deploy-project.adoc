== Deploy the {ProductShortName} Source-to-Image (S2I) Quickstart to OpenShift with Helm Charts

Log in to your OpenShift instance using the `oc login` command.
The backend will be built and deployed on OpenShift with a Helm Chart for {productName}.

Navigate to the root directory of this quickstart and run the following command:
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
$ helm install {artifactId} -f charts/helm.yaml {helmChartName}
NAME: {artifactId}
...
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
----

The Helm Chart for this quickstart contains all the information to build an image from the source code using S2I on Java 17:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
build:
  uri: {githubRepoCodeUrl}
  contextDir: {artifactId}
deploy:
  replicas: 1
----

This will create a new deployment on OpenShift and deploy the application.

If you want to see all the configuration elements to customize your deployment you can use the following command:
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
$ helm show readme {helmChartName}
----

Letâ€™s wait for the application to be built and deployed:
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
$ oc get deployment {artifactId} -w
NAME         DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
{artifactId}   1         1         1            0           12s
...
{artifactId}   1         1         1            1           2m
----

Get the URL of the route to the deployment.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
$ oc get route {artifactId} -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}"
----
Access the application in your web browser using the displayed URL.

[NOTE]
====
The Maven profile named `openshift` is used by the Helm chart to provision the server with the quickstart deployed on the root web context, and thus the application should be accessed with the URL without the `/{artifactId}` path segment after `HOST:PORT`.
