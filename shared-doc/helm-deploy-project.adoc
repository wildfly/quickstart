== Deploy the {ProductShortName} Source-to-Image (S2I) Quickstart to OpenShift with Helm Charts

Log in to your OpenShift instance using the `oc login` command.
The backend will be built and deployed on OpenShift with a Helm Chart for {productName}.

Navigate to the root directory of this quickstart and run the following command:
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
$ helm install {helm-app-name} {helm_chart_values} --wait --timeout=10m0s
NAME: {helm-app-name}
...
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
----

This command will return once the application has successfully deployed. In case of a timeout, you can check the status of the application with the following command in another terminal:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
oc get deployment {helm-app-name}
----

The Helm Chart for this quickstart contains all the information to build an image from the source code using S2I on Java 17:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
build:
  uri: {githubRepoCodeUrl}
  ref: {WildFlyQuickStartRepoTag}
  contextDir: {artifactId}
deploy:
  replicas: 1
----

This will create a new deployment on OpenShift and deploy the application.

If you want to see all the configuration elements to customize your deployment you can use the following command:
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
$ helm show readme {helmChartName}
----


Get the URL of the route to the deployment.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
$ oc get route {helm-app-name} -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}"
----
Access the application in your web browser using the displayed URL.

[NOTE]
====
The Maven profile named `openshift` is used by the Helm chart to provision the server with the quickstart deployed on the root web context, and thus the application should be accessed with the URL without the `/{artifactId}` path segment after `HOST:PORT`.
