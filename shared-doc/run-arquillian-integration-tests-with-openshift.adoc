= Run the Arquillian Integration Tests with OpenShift
//******************************************************************************
// Include this template if your quickstart provides Openshift Arquillian
// integration tests.
//******************************************************************************

This quickstart includes Arquillian integration tests. They are located under the  `src/test/` directory. The integration tests verify that the quickstart runs correctly when deployed on the server.

[NOTE]
====
The Arquillian integration tests expect a deployed application, so make sure you have deployed the quickstart on OpenShift before you begin.
====

Run the integration tests using the following command to run the `verify` goal with the `arq-remote` profile activated and the proper URL:
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]

$ mvn clean verify -Parq-remote -Dserver.host=https://$(oc get route {artifactId} --template='{{ .spec.host }}')
