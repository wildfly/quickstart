h2-console: Example Using the H2 Console with WildFly
===================================================
Author: Pete Muir  
Level: Beginner  
Technologies: H2  
Summary: The `h2-console` quickstart demonstrates how to use the H2 Console that is bundled with and built specifically for WildFly.  
Target Product: WildFly  
Source: <https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/>

What is it?
-----------

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform bundles H2 as an in-memory, in-process database. H2 is written in Java so it can run on any platform that WildFly runs on.

The `h2-console` quickstart comes bundled with a version of the H2 Console built for WildFly. To make the H2 console run on WildFly, the H2 libraries were removed from the WAR and a dependency on the H2 module was added to the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file. The rebuilt console is provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

This quickstart demonstrates how to use the H2 console with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. It uses the `greeter` quickstart as a GUI for entering data.

_Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!_

System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7 or later. 

All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.1.1 or later. See [Configure Maven for WildFly 7](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.


Prerequisites
-----------

This quickstart depends on the deployment of the `greeter` quickstart. Before running this quickstart, see the [greeter README](../greeter/README.md) file for details on how to deploy it.

You can verify the deployment of the `greeter` quickstart by accessing the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/wildfly-greeter> 

When you have completed testing this quickstart, see the [greeter README](../greeter/README.md) file for instructions to undeploy the archive.


Use of WILDFLY_HOME
---------------

In the following instructions, replace `WILDFLY_HOME` with the actual path to your WildFly installation. The installation path is described in detail here: [Use of WILDFLY_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP7_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables).


Deploy the H2 Console
------------------------

Deploy the console by copying the `h2console.war` located in the root directory of this quickstart to the `WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/deployments` directory. 


Access the H2 Console 
---------------------

You can access the console at the following URL:  <http://localhost:8080/h2console>.

You need to enter the JDBC URL, and credentials. To access the "test" database that the `greeter` quickstart uses, enter these details:

* JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:greeter-quickstart;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1`
* User Name: `sa`
* Password: `sa`

Click on the *Test Connection* button to make sure you can connect. If you can, go ahead and click *Connect*.

Investigate the H2 Console
-------------------------

Take a look at the data added by the `greeter` application. Run the following SQL command:

        select * from users;

You should see the two users seeded by the `greeter` quickstart, plus any users you added when testing that application.

Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

To undeploy this example, simply delete the `h2console.war` from the `WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/deployments` directory. 

     cd WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/deployments
     rm h2console.war
