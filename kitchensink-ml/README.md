Summary: The `kitchensink-ml` quickstart demonstrates a localized Java EE 7 compliant application using JSF, CDI, EJB, JPA and Bean Validation.  
Target Product: WildFly

What is it?
-----------

The `kitchensink-ml` quickstart is a deployable Maven 3 project to help you get your foot in the door developing with Java EE 7 on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. 

It demonstrates how to create a _localized_ Java EE 7 compliant application using JSF, CDI, JAX-RS, EJB, JPA and Bean Validation 1.0. A localized application is one that supports multiple languages. That is what the _-ml_ suffix denotes in the quickstart name _kitchensink-ml_. This quickstart also includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence and transaction code to introduce you to database access in enterprise Java. 

This quickstart uses the [kitchensink](../kitchensink/README.md) quickstart as its starting point. It has been enhanced to provide localization of labels and messages. A user sets the preferred language choice in the browser and, if the application supports that language, the application web page is rendered in that language. For demonstration purposes, this quickstart has been tranlated into French(fr) and Spanish (es) using <http://translate.google.com>, so the translations may not be ideal.

_Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!_
  
_Note: This quickstart uses a `*-ds.xml` datasource configuration file for convenience and ease of database configuration. These files are deprecated in WildFly and should not be used in a production environment. Instead, you should configure the datasource using the Management CLI or Management Console. Datasource configuration is documented in the [Administration and Configuration Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/) for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform._

### Localization Code Changes

The following changes were made to the quickstart to enable it to use the browser preferred locale setting when displaying the web page:

* Properties files were created for the supported languages. 

    * This quickstart is localized for Spanish  and  French. You can add additional language support by creating properties files with the appropriate suffix and populating the properties with translated values.
    
    * The JSF resource Bundle is located at `src/main/resources/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/kitchensink/bundle/Resources_(es|fr).properties
    
    * Messages generated by Java code (e.g. log messages and messages sent to the UI) are internationalized using JBoss Logging. The log messages are accessed via the `org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.util.KitchensinkMessages` interface, and the message bundles are located at: `src/main/resources/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/kitchensink/util/KitchensinkMessages.i18_(es|fr).properties`
    
    * The message bundle consumed by Bean Validation is located at `src/main/resources/ValidationMessages.properties' (this is defined by the bean validation specification).

* The following XML was added to the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/faces-config.xml` file. When you create a property file for a new language, you must add the supported locale to this file.

        <application>
          <locale-config>
            <default-locale>en</default-locale>
            <supported-locale>en-US</supported-locale>
            <supported-locale>fr</supported-locale>
            <supported-locale>fr-FR</supported-locale>
            <supported-locale>es</supported-locale>
            <supported-locale>es-ES</supported-locale>
          </locale-config>
          <resource-bundle>
            <base-name>org/jboss/as/quickstarts/kitchensink/bundle/Resources</base-name>
            <var>bundle</var>
          </resource-bundle>
        </application>
        
* The `src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/kitchensink/model/Member.java` file was modififed to add the message key to @Pattern annotation.
     
         @NotNull
         @Size(min = 1, max = 25)
         @Pattern(regexp = "[A-Za-z ]*", message = "{name_validation_message}")
         private String name;                

* The `src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/kitchensink/util/KitchensinkMessages.java` file was created, which defines default messages in English. The `jboss-logging-processor` will automatically generate an implementation for you, which can be accesssed via the `MESSAGES` static variable.

        @MessageBundle(projectCode = "")
        public interface KitchensinkMessages {
        
           KitchensinkMessages MESSAGES = Messages.getBundle(KitchensinkMessages.class, FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getViewRoot().getLocale());
        
           @Message("Registered!")
           String registeredMessage();
       
           @Message("Successfully registered!")
           String registerSuccessfulMessage();
        
           @Message("Registration failed:")
           String registerFailMessage();
        
           @Message("Registration failed. See server log for more information.")
           String defaultErrorMessage();
        }

* The `src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/kitchensink/controller/MemberController.java` file was modified as follows:

    * Messages strings were replaced with strings retrieved using the resource bundle property names. For example:
    
            FacesMessage m = new FacesMessage(FacesMessage.SEVERITY_INFO, 
                    KitchensinkMessages.MESSAGES.registeredMessage(),
                    KitchensinkMessages.MESSAGES.registerSuccessfulMessage());

* The `src/main/webapp/index.xhtml` file were modified.

    * Strings for headers, messages, labels were replaced with the appropriate `# {bundle.<property>}`, for example: `# {bundle.memberWelcomeHeader}`.
    
### Set the Browser Preferred Locale
