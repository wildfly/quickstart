=== Install OpenTelemetry Collector on OpenShift

The functionality of this quickstart depends on a running instance of the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/[OpenTelemetry Collector].

To deploy and configure the OpenTelemetry Collector, you will need to apply a set of configurations to your OpenShift cluster:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
include::charts/opentelemetry-collector.yaml[]
----

To make things simpler, you can find these commands in `charts/opentelemetry-collector.yaml`, and to apply them run the following command in your terminal:

[source]
----
$ oc apply -f charts/opentelemetry-collector.yaml
----

[NOTE]
====
When done with the quickstart, the `oc delete -f charts/opentelemetry-collector.yaml` command may be used to revert the applied changes.
