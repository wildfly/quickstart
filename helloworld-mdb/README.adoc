[abstract]
The `helloworld-mdb` quickstart uses *JMS* and *EJB Message-Driven Bean* (MDB) to create and deploy JMS topic and queue resources in {productName}.

== What is it?

The `helloworld-mdb` quickstart demonstrates the use of _JMS_ and _EJB Message-Driven Bean_ in {productNameFull}.

This project creates two JMS resources:

* A queue named `HELLOWORLDMDBQueue` bound in JNDI as `java:/queue/HELLOWORLDMDBQueue`
* A topic named `HELLOWORLDMDBTopic` bound in JNDI as `java:/topic/HELLOWORLDMDBTopic`

== System Requirements

The application this project produces is designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

All you need to build this project is {buildRequirements}. See https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts[Configure Maven for {productName} {productVersion}] to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

== Use of {jbossHomeName}

In the following instructions, replace `{jbossHomeName}` with the actual path to your {productName} installation. The installation path is described in detail here: https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_{jbossHomeName}.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables[Use of {jbossHomeName} and JBOSS_HOME Variables].

== Start the Server with the Full Profile

. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. The following shows the command line to start the server with the full profile:

[subs=normal]
----
For Linux:   {jbossHomeName}/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
For Windows: {jbossHomeName}\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml
----

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
+
----
mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
----

. This will deploy `target/{artifactId}.war` to the running instance of the server. Look at the {productName} console or Server log and you should see log messages corresponding to the deployment of the message-driven beans and the JMS destinations:
+
----
...

INFO  [org.jboss.as.ejb3] (MSC service thread 1-6) WFLYEJB0042: Started message driven bean 'HelloWorldQTopicMDB' with 'activemq-ra.rar' resource adapter
----

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/ and will send some messages to the queue.

To send messages to the topic, use the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/HelloWorldMDBServletClient?topic

== Investigate the Server Console Output

Look at the {productName} console or Server log and you should see log messages like the following:

----
INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldQueueMDB] (Thread-9 (ActiveMQ-client-global-threads-1189700957)) Received Message from queue: This is message 5
INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldQueueMDB] (Thread-6 (ActiveMQ-client-global-threads-1189700957)) Received Message from queue: This is message 1
INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldQueueMDB] (Thread-7 (ActiveMQ-client-global-threads-1189700957)) Received Message from queue: This is message 4
INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldQueueMDB] (Thread-5 (ActiveMQ-client-global-threads-1189700957)) Received Message from queue: This is message 2
INFO  [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldQueueMDB] (Thread-4 (ActiveMQ-client-global-threads-1189700957)) Received Message from queue: This is message 3
----

== Undeploy the Archive

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:
+
----
mvn wildfly:undeploy
----

== Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a {productName} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:{useEclipseUrl}[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].

NOTE: Within JBoss Developer Studio, be sure to define a server runtime environment that uses the `standalone-full.xml` configuration file.

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

----
mvn dependency:sources
