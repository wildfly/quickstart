[abstract]
The `temperature-converter` quickstart does temperature conversion using an EJB Stateless Session Bean (SLSB), CDI, and a JSF front-end client.

:standalone-server-type: default
:archiveType: war

== What is it?

The `temperature-converter` example demonstrates the use of an EJB Stateless Session Bean (SLSB) and CDI, accessed using a JSF, and deployed to {productNameFull} using a WAR archive.

The application does the following:

. The User Interface is a JSF page that asks for a temperature and a scale (Fahrenheit or Celsius).
. When you click on `Convert`, the temperature string is passed to the TemperatureConverter controller (managed) bean.
. The managed bean then invokes the `convert()` method of the injected TemperatureConvertEJB (notice the field annotated with @Inject).
. The response from TemperatureConvertEJB is stored in the `temperature` field of the managed bean.
. The managed bean is annotated as @SessionScoped, so the same managed bean instance is used for the entire session.
