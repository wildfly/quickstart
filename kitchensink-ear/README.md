kitchensink-ear: Using Multiple Java EE 7 Technologies Deployed as an EAR
==============================================================================================
Author: Pete Muir  
Level: Intermediate  
Technologies: CDI, JSF, JPA, EJB, JAX-RS, BV, EAR  
Summary: The `kitchensink-ear` quickstart demonstrates web-enabled database application, using JSF, CDI, EJB, JPA and Bean Validation, packaged as an EAR.   
Target Product: WildFly    
Source: <https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/>  

What is it?
-----------

The `kitchensink-ear` quickstart is a deployable Maven 3 project to help you get your foot in the door developing with Java EE 7 on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. 

It demonstrates how to create a compliant Java EE 7 application using JSF, CDI, JAX-RS, EJB, JPA and Bean Validation 1.0. It includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence and transaction code to introduce you to database access in enterprise Java. It is based on the [kitchensink](../kitchensink/README.md) quickstart but is packaged as an EAR archive.

_Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!_

_Note: This quickstart uses a `*-ds.xml` datasource configuration file for convenience and ease of database configuration. These files are deprecated in WildFly and should not be used in a production environment. Instead, you should configure the datasource using the Management CLI or Management Console. Datasource configuration is documented in the [Administration and Configuration Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/) for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform._


System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7 or later. 

All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.1.1 or later. See [Configure Maven for WildFly 7](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.


Use of WILDFLY_HOME
---------------

In the following instructions, replace `WILDFLY_HOME` with the actual path to your WildFly installation. The installation path is described in detail here: [Use of WILDFLY_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP7_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables).


Start the WildFly Server
-------------------------

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the WildFly directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server:

        For Linux:   WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: WILDFLY_HOME\bin\standalone.bat

 
Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------

1. Make sure you have started the WildFly server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean install wildfly:deploy

4. This will deploy `ear/target/wildfly-kitchensink-ear.ear` to the running instance of the server.


Access the application 
---------------------

The application will be running at the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/wildfly-kitchensink-ear-web>.

1. Enter a name, email address, and Phone nubmer in the input field and click the _Register_ button.
2. If the data entered is valid, the new member will be registered and added to the _Members_ display list.
3. If the data is not valid, you must fix the validation errors and try again.
4. When the registration is successful, you will see a log message in the server console:

        Registering _the_name_you_entered_


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

1. Make sure you have started the WildFly server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn wildfly:undeploy


Run the Arquillian Tests 
-------------------------

This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container. 

1. Make sure you have started the WildFly server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:

        mvn clean test -Parq-wildfly-remote 


Investigate the Console Output
---------------------
You should see the following console output when you run the tests:

    Results :
    Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0


Investigate the Server Console Output
---------------------
You should see messages similar to the following:

    INFO  [org.jboss.as.server.deployment] (MSC service thread 1-3) WFLYSRV0027: Starting deployment of "test.war" (runtime-name: "test.war")
    ...
    INFO  [org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink_ear.service.MemberRegistration] (default task-102) Registering Jane Doe
    INFO  [org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink_ear.test.MemberRegistrationTest] (default task-102) Jane Doe was persisted with id 1
    ...
    INFO  [org.jboss.as.server.deployment] (MSC service thread 1-2) WFLYSRV0028: Stopped deployment test.war (runtime-name: test.war) in 38ms
    ....
    INFO  [org.jboss.as.server] (management-handler-thread - 22) WFLYSRV0009: Undeployed "test.war" (runtime-name: "test.war")


Server Log: Expected warnings and errors
-----------------------------------

_Note:_ You will see the following warnings in the server log. You can ignore these warnings.

    WFLYJCA0091: -ds.xml file deployments are deprecated. Support may be removed in a future version.

    HHH000431: Unable to determine H2 database version, certain features may not work


Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------
You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a WildFly server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) 


Debug the Application
---------------------

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

        mvn dependency:sources
