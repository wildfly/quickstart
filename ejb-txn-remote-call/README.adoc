[abstract]
The `ejb-txn-remote-call` quickstart demonstrates remote transactional EJB calls over two application servers of {productName}.

:standalone-server-type: ha
:archiveType: war
:requires-multiple-servers:

== What is it?

The `ejb-txn-remote-call` quickstart demonstrates the remote transactional EJB calls over two {productNameFull}s. The remote side forms a HA cluster.

== Description

This quickstart demonstrates how EJB remote calls propagate JTA transaction across {productNameFull}s. Further, this quickstart demonstrates the transaction recovery, which is run for both servers when a failure occurs.

This quickstart contains two Maven projects.
The first maven project represents the sender side, and is intended to be deployed on the first {productName} (`server1`).
The second project represents the receiver side. This project is intended to be deployed
to the other two {productName} (`server2` and `server3`). The two projects must not be deployed to the same server.

[cols="40%,60%",options="headers"]
|===
|Project |Description

|`client`
|The application deployed to the first {productName} server.
Users can interact with this application through some REST endpoints, which start remote EJB calls toward the `server` application
deployed on the other two {productName}s.
In more details, the transaction initiated at the client side enlists two participants: a database, and the EJB remote server.
The transaction manager then uses the two-phase commit to commit the transactions over the two servers.
Moreover, this quickstart shows how transactional failures how dealt with.

|`server`
|The application deployed to the second and third {productName} servers.
This application receives the remote EJB calls from the `client` application and,
depending on the scenario, process the propagated transaction.
In more details, the transaction initiated at the server side enlists two participants: a database, and a mock XAResource.

== Running the Quickstart

This quickstart demonstrates its functionalities on <<_running_in_a_bare_metal_environment, bare metal>>, using {productName} Maven plugin, and on OpenShift.

// System Requirements
include::../shared-doc/system-requirements.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
// Use of {jbossHomeName}_1 and {jbossHomeName}_2
include::../shared-doc/use-of-jboss-home-name.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== The Goal

The EJB remote call propagates transaction from `client` application
to `server` application. The remote call hits one of the two servers where the `server` application is deployed.

== Running in a bare metal environment

First of all, three {productName} servers needs to be configured. Then, the `client` application gets deployed to the first server (`server1`),
while the `server` application gets deployed to the other two {productName} servers (`server2`, and `server3`, which are configured as a cluster).

[[_setup_productname_servers]]
=== Setup {productName} servers

The easiest way to start multiple instances of {productName} on a local computer is to copy the {productName} installation directory
to three separate directories.

The installation directories are named:

* `__{jbossHomeName}_1__` for `server1`
* `__{jbossHomeName}_2__` for `server2`
* `__{jbossHomeName}_3__` for `server3`

Given that the installation directory of the {productName} is identified with ${jbossHomeName}:
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cp -r ${jbossHomeName} server1; \
{jbossHomeName}_1="$PWD/server1"
----
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cp -r ${jbossHomeName} server2; \
{jbossHomeName}_2="$PWD/server2"
----
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cp -r ${jbossHomeName} server3; \
{jbossHomeName}_3="$PWD/server3"
----

=== Creating a user for `server2` and `server3`

To successfully process EJB remote calls from `server1` to either `server2`
or to `server3` a user to authenticate the EJB remote calls must be created on the receiving servers.

Run the following procedure in the directories `__{jbossHomeName}_2__` and `__{jbossHomeName}_3__` to create the user for `server2` and `server3`.

[#add_application_user]
// Add the Authorized Application User
include::../shared-doc/add-application-user.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

[NOTE]
====
For the `add-user.sh` (or `.bat`) command you, can add the parameter `-ds`.
When you include this parameter, after the user is added, the system outputs a secret value that you can use to set up the remote output connection on `server1`.

The output of command when `-ds` parameter is used:

[code,sh]
----
To represent the user add the following to the server-identities definition <secret value="cXVpY2tzdGFydFB3ZDEh" />
----
====

=== Configure datasources

As this quickstart performs transactional work against a database, it is needed to create a new database.
For the purpose of this quickstart, a simple PostgreSQL container will be used:

[source,sh]
----
podman run -p 5432:5432 --rm  -ePOSTGRES_DB=test -ePOSTGRES_USER=test -ePOSTGRES_PASSWORD=test postgres:9.4 -c max-prepared-transactions=110 -c log-statement=all
----

The {productName} servers need to be configured to be able to connect to the database.
First of all, a JDBC driver needs to be installed as https://docs.wildfly.org/30/Developer_Guide.html#Class_Loading_in_WildFly[jboss module].

The following command (along packaging the `client` and the `server` applications) downloads the PostgreSQL driver automatically through Maven:
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cd ${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call;
mvn clean package
----
Then, the PostgreSQL driver needs to be loaded as jboss module in all {productName} servers:

[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cd ${jbossHomeName}_1; \
./bin/jboss-cli.sh "embed-server,\
  module add --name=org.postgresql.jdbc \
  --resources=${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/client/target/postgresql/postgresql.jar"
----
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cd ${jbossHomeName}_2; \
./bin/jboss-cli.sh "embed-server,\
  module add --name=org.postgresql.jdbc \
  --resources=${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/client/target/postgresql/postgresql.jar"
----
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cd ${jbossHomeName}_3; \
./bin/jboss-cli.sh "embed-server,\
  module add --name=org.postgresql.jdbc \
  --resources=${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/client/target/postgresql/postgresql.jar"
----

Moreover, the PostgreSQL driver needs to be installed on all {productName} servers.
For `server1`, the configuration file `standalone.xml` will be used.
For `server2` and `server3` the configuration file `standalone-ha.xml` will be used.

[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cd ${jbossHomeName}_1; \
./bin/jboss-cli.sh "embed-server --server-config=standalone.xml,\
  /subsystem=datasources/jdbc-driver=postgresql:add(driver-name=postgresql,driver-module-name=org.postgresql.jdbc,driver-xa-datasource-class-name=org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource)"
----
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cd ${jbossHomeName}_2; \
./bin/jboss-cli.sh "embed-server --server-config=standalone-ha.xml,\
  /subsystem=datasources/jdbc-driver=postgresql:add(driver-name=postgresql,driver-module-name=org.postgresql.jdbc,driver-xa-datasource-class-name=org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource)"
----
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cd ${jbossHomeName}_3; \
./bin/jboss-cli.sh "embed-server --server-config=standalone-ha.xml,\
  /subsystem=datasources/jdbc-driver=postgresql:add(driver-name=postgresql,driver-module-name=org.postgresql.jdbc,driver-xa-datasource-class-name=org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource)"
----

Finally, it is time to run the scripts for adding the PostgreSQL datasource to the {productName} servers:

[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cd ${jbossHomeName}_1; \
./bin/jboss-cli.sh -DpostgresqlUsername="test" -DpostgresqlPassword="test" \
  --file=${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/client/scripts/postgresql-datasource.cli \
  --properties=${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/client/scripts/cli.local.properties
----
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cd ${jbossHomeName}_2; \
./bin/jboss-cli.sh -DpostgresqlUsername="test" -DpostgresqlPassword="test" \
  --file=${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/server/scripts/postgresql-datasource.cli \
  --properties=${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/server/scripts/cli.local.properties
----
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cd ${jbossHomeName}_3; \
./bin/jboss-cli.sh -DpostgresqlUsername="test" -DpostgresqlPassword="test" \
  --file=${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/server/scripts/postgresql-datasource.cli \
  --properties=${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/server/scripts/cli.local.properties
----

=== Configuring EJB remoting on `server1`

EJB remote calls from `server1` to either `server2` or `server3` need to be authenticated. To achieve
this configuration, the script `${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/client/scripts/remoting-configuration.cli`
will be executed on `server1`.

[NOTE]
====
`remoting-configuration.cli` is configured with properties in `cli.local.properties` and runs against `standalone.xml`
====

[[remote_configuration_cli]]
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cd ${jbossHomeName}_1; \
./bin/jboss-cli.sh -DremoteServerUsername="quickstartUser" -DremoteServerPassword="quickstartPwd1!" \
  --file=${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/client/scripts/remoting-configuration.cli \
  --properties=${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/client/scripts/cli.local.properties
----

NOTE: For Windows, use the `bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.

Running `remoting-configuration.cli` results in the creation of:

* A `remote outbound socket` that points to the port on `server2`/`server3` where EJB remoting endpoints can be reached
* A https://docs.wildfly.org/22/wildscribe/subsystem/remoting/remote-outbound-connection/index.html[`remote outbound connection`] that can be referenced in the war deployment with `jboss-ejb-client.xml` descriptor
(see `${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/client/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jboss-ejb-client.xml`).
* An authentication context `auth_context` that is used by the new created remoting connection `remote-ejb-connection`; the authentication context uses the same username and password created for `server2` and `server3`

[#_start_productname_servers]
=== Start {productName} servers

At this point, the configuration of the {productName} servers is completed.
`server1` must be started with the `standalone.xml` configuration,
while `server2` and `server3` must be started with the `standalone-ha.xml` configuration to create a cluster.
As all {productName} servers will be run in the same bare metal environment,
a port offset will be applied to `server2` and `server3`. Moreover,
each server has to define a unique transaction node identifier and jboss node name.

Start each server in a separate terminal.

[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
cd ${jbossHomeName}_1; \
./bin/standalone.sh -c standalone.xml -Djboss.tx.node.id=server1 -Djboss.node.name=server1 -Dwildfly.config.url=${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/client/configuration/custom-config.xml
----
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
cd ${jbossHomeName}_2; \
./bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.tx.node.id=server2 -Djboss.node.name=server2 -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
----
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
cd ${jbossHomeName}_3; \
./bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.tx.node.id=server3 -Djboss.node.name=server3 -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=200
----

NOTE: To enable the recovery of remote transaction failures, the configuration file `custom-config.xml`
should be loaded into `server1`; this operation will authenticate `server1` against `server2`/`server3`.

NOTE: For Windows, use the `bin\standalone.bat` script.

=== Deploying the Quickstart applications

. With all {productName} servers <<_setup_productname_servers, configured>> and <<_start_productname_servers, running>>,
the `client` and `server` application can be deployed

. The whole project can be built using the following commands:
+
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
cd ${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/
mvn clean package
----
+
. Then, the `client` application can be deployed using the following commands:
+
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
cd ${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/client
mvn wildfly:deploy
----
+
. Lastly, the `server` application can be deployed using the following commands:
+
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
cd ${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/server
mvn wildfly:deploy -Dwildfly.port=10090
mvn wildfly:deploy -Dwildfly.port=10190
----

The commands just run employed the WildFly Maven plugin to connect to the running instances of {productName}
and deploy the `war` archives to the servers.

[#_examining_the_quickstart]
=== Examining the Quickstart

Once the {productName} servers are configured and started, and the quickstart artifacts are deployed, it is possible to
invoke the endpoints of `server1`, which generate EJB remote invocations against the HA cluster formed by `server2` and `server3`.

The following table defines the available endpoints, and their expected behaviour.

[NOTE]
====
The endpoints return data in JSON format. You can use `curl` for the invocation
and `jq` for formatting the results. For example:

`curl -s http://localhost:8080/client/remote-outbound-stateless | jq .`
====

[NOTE]
====
On Windows, `curl` and `jq` might not be available.
If so, enter the endpoints directly to a browser of your choice.
The behaviour and the obtained JSON will be the same as for the `curl` command.
====

The HTTP invocations return the hostnames of the contacted servers.

[[rest-endpoints]]
[options="headers"]
.HTTP endpoints of the test invocation
|===
|URL |Behaviour |Expectation

|__http://localhost:8080/client/remote-outbound-stateless__
|Two invocations under the transaction context started on `server1` (`client` application).
The EJB remote call is configured from the `remote-outbound-connection`.
Both calls are directed to the same remote server instance (`server` application)
due to transaction affinity.
|The two returned hostnames must be the same.

|__http://localhost:8080/client/remote-outbound-notx-stateless__
|Several remote invocations to stateless EJB without a transaction context.
The EJB remote call is configured from the `remote-outbound-connection`.
The EJB client is expected to load balance the calls on various servers.
|The list of the returned hostnames should contain occurrences of both
 `server2` and `server3`.

|__http://localhost:8080/client/direct-stateless__
|Two invocations under the transaction context started on `server1` (`client` application). The stateless bean is invoked on the remote side.
The EJB remote call is configured from data in the `client` application source code.
The remote invocation is run via the EJB remoting protocol.
|The returned hostnames must be the same.

|__http://localhost:8080/client/direct-stateless-http__
|Two invocations under the transaction context started on `server1` (`client` application). The stateless bean is invoked on the remote side.
The EJB remote call is configured from data in the `client` application source code.
The remote invocation is run, unlike the other calls of this quickstarts, via https://docs.wildfly.org/22/Developer_Guide.html#EJB_over_HTTP[EJB over HTTP].
|The returned hostnames must be the same.

|__http://localhost:8080/client/remote-outbound-notx-stateful__
|Two invocations under the transaction context started on `server1` (`client` application).
The EJB remote call is configured from the `remote-outbound-connection`.
Both calls are directed to the same stateful bean on the remote server because
the stateful bean invocations are sticky ensuring affinity to the same server instance.
|The returned hostnames must be the same.

|__http://localhost:8080/client/remote-outbound-fail-stateless__
|An invocation under the transaction context started on `server1` (`client` application).
The call goes to one of the remote servers, where errors occur during transaction processing.
The failure is simulated at time of two-phase commit.
This HTTP call finishes with success. Only the server log shows some warnings.
This is an expected behaviour. An intermittent failure during commit phase
of two-phase protocol makes the transaction manager obliged to finish the work
eventually. The finalization of work is done in the background
(by Narayana recovery manager, see details <<_details_on_recovery, below>>), and the HTTP call may inform the client back with success.
|When the recovery manager finishes the work all the transaction resources are committed.

|===

[[_details_on_recovery]]
==== Observing the recovery processing after __client/remote-outbound-fail-stateless__ call

The EJB call to the endpoint `client/remote-outbound-fail-stateless` simulates the presence
of an intermittent network error happening at the commit phase of the two-phase commit protocol (2PC).

The http://jbossts.blogspot.com/2018/01/narayana-periodic-recovery-of-xa.html[transaction recovery manager]
periodically tries to recover the unfinished work and only when this attempt is successful,
the transaction is completed (which makes the update in the database visible). It is possible to confirm the completion of
the transaction by invoking the REST endpoint `server/commits` at both servers `server2` and `server3`.


[source]
----
curl -s http://localhost:8180/server/commits
----

[source]
----
curl -s http://localhost:8280/server/commits
----

The response of `server/commits` is a tuple composed by the host's info and the number of commits.
For example the output could be `["host: mydev.narayana.io/192.168.0.1, jboss node name: server2","3"]`
and it says that the hostname is `mydev.narayana.io`, the jboss node name is `server2`,
and the number of commits is `3`.

The Transaction recovery manager runs periodically (by default, it runs every 2 minutes) on all servers.
Nevertheless, as the transaction is initiated on `server1`, the recovery manager on this server will be
responsible to initiate the recovery process.

[NOTE]
====
The recovery process can be started manually. Using `telnet` and connecting to `localhost:4712`
(i.e. the port where https://docs.wildfly.org/22/wildscribe/subsystem/transactions/index.html#attr-recovery-listener[the recovery process is listening to]),
it is possible to send the `SCAN` command to force a recovery cycle

[[build_and_run_the_quickstart_with_provisioned_server]]
== Building and running the quickstart application with provisioned {productName} server

Instead of using a standard {productName} server distribution, the three {productName} servers to deploy and run the quickstart can be alternatively provisioned by activating the Maven profile named `provisioned-server` when building the quickstart:

[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
cd ${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/client;
mvn clean package -Pprovisioned-server \
  -DremoteServerUsername="quickstartUser" -DremoteServerPassword="quickstartPwd1!"
----
[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
cd ${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/server;
mvn clean package -Pprovisioned-server \
  -Dwildfly.provisioning.dir=server2 -Djboss-as.home=target/server2 ;
mvn package -Pprovisioned-server \
  -Dwildfly.provisioning.dir=server3 -Djboss-as.home=target/server3
----

The provisioned {productName} servers, with the quickstart deployed, can then be found in the `target/server` directory, and their usage is similar to a standard server distribution, with the simplification that there is never the need to specify the server configuration to be started.

The server provisioning functionality is provided by the WildFly Maven Plugin, and you may find its configuration in the pom.xml files of the quickstart.

The quickstart user should be added before running the provisioned server:
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
cd ${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/server;
./target/server2/bin/add-user.sh -a -u 'quickstartUser' -p 'quickstartPwd1!';
./target/server3/bin/add-user.sh -a -u 'quickstartUser' -p 'quickstartPwd1!'
----
[NOTE]
====
For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\add-user.bat` script.
====

=== Run the Integration Tests with a provisioned server

The integration tests included with this quickstart, which verify that the quickstart runs correctly, may also be run with provisioned server.

Follow these steps to run the integration tests.

. As this quickstart performs transactional work against a database, it is needed to create a new database. For the purpose of this quickstart, a simple PostgreSQL container will be used:
+
[source,sh]
----
podman run -p 5432:5432 --rm  -ePOSTGRES_DB=test -ePOSTGRES_USER=test -ePOSTGRES_PASSWORD=test postgres:9.4 -c max-prepared-transactions=110 -c log-statement=all
----

. Make sure the servers are provisioned by running the commands reported in <<build_and_run_the_quickstart_with_provisioned_server>>

. Add the quickstart user to the provisioned `server2` and `server3` by running the commands reported in <<build_and_run_the_quickstart_with_provisioned_server>>

. Start the {productName} provisioned servers in three distinct terminals, this time using the {productName} Maven Plugin, which is recommended for testing due to simpler automation.

== Running on OpenShift

The ephemeral nature of OpenShift does not work smoothly with {productName}'s ability to handle transactions.
In fact, {productName}'s transaction management saves logs to keep record of transactions' history in case of
extreme scenarios, like crashes or network issues. Moreover, EJB remoting requires a stable remote endpoint
to guarantee:

* The transaction affinity of `stateful beans` and
* The recovery of transactions.

To fulfil the aforementioned requirements, applications that requires ACID transactions _**must be**_ deployed
to {productName} using the {productName}'s Operator, which can employ OpenShift's _StatefulSet_. Failing to do so
might result in no-ACID transactions.

=== Prerequisites

[#_install_operator]
==== Install {productName}'s Operator

To install {productName}'s Operator, follow the https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-operator[official documentation]
(which instructions are also reported here for convenience)

ifndef::ProductRelease,EAPCDRelease,EAPXPRelease[]
[source,sh,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-operator.git

cd wildfly-operator

oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin developer
make install
make deploy
----
endif::[]

To verify that the {productName} Operator is running, execute the following command:

ifndef::ProductRelease,EAPCDRelease,EAPXPRelease[]
[source,sh,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
oc get po -n $(oc project -q)

NAME                                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
wildfly-operator-5d4b7cc868-zfxcv   1/1     Running     1          22h
----
endif::[]

[#_start_postgresql_database]
==== Start a PostgreSQL database

This quickstart requires a PostgreSQL database to run correctly. In the scope of this quickstart,
a PostgreSQL database will be deployed on the OpenShift instance using the Helm chart provided by
https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql[bitnami]:

[source,sh,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install postgresql bitnami/postgresql -f charts/postgresql.yaml --wait --timeout="5m"
----

[#_build_the_application]
=== Build the applications

To build the `client` and the `server` applications, this quickstart employs
{productName}'s https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-charts/tree/main[Helm charts].
For more information about {productName}'s Helm chart, please refer to the official
https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-charts/blob/main/charts/wildfly/README.md[documentation].

ifndef::ProductRelease,EAPCDRelease,EAPXPRelease[]
[source,sh,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
helm repo add wildfly https://docs.wildfly.org/wildfly-charts/

helm install client -f charts/client.yaml wildfly/wildfly
helm install server -f charts/server.yaml wildfly/wildfly
----
endif::[]

Wait for the builds to finish. Their status can be verified by executing the `oc get pod` command.

[#_deploy_the_quickstart]
=== Deploy the Quickstart

To deploy the `client` and the `server` applications, this quickstart uses the `WildFlyServer` custom resource,
thanks to which the {productName} Operator is able to create a {productName} pod and
deploy an application.

NOTE: Make sure that `view` permissions are granted to the default system account.
The `KUBE_PING` protocol, which is used for forming the HA {productName} cluster
on OpenShift, requires `view` permissions to read the labels of the pods:
`oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:$(oc project -q):default -n $(oc project -q)`

[source,sh,options="nowrap"]
----
cd ${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call;
oc create -f client/client-cr.yaml;
oc create -f server/server-cr.yaml
----

If the above commands are successful, the `oc get pod` command shows
all the pods required for the quickstart, i.e. the `client` pod and two
`server` pods (and the PostgreSQL database).

[source,sh,options="nowrap"]
----
NAME                                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
client-0                            1/1     Running     0          29m
postgresql-f9f475f87-l944r          1/1     Running     1          22h
server-0                            1/1     Running     0          11m
server-1                            1/1     Running     0          11m
----

[#_verify_the_quickstarts]
==== Verify the Quickstarts

The {productName} Operator creates routes that make the `client` and the `server` applications accessible
outside the OpenShift environment. The `oc get route` command shows the addresses of the HTTP endpoints.
An example of the output is:

[source,sh,options="nowrap"]
----
oc get route

NAME           HOST/PORT                                                            PATH   SERVICES              PORT
client-route   client-route-ejb-txn-remote-call-client-artifacts.apps-crc.testing          client-loadbalancer   http
server-route   server-route-ejb-txn-remote-call-client-artifacts.apps-crc.testing          server-loadbalancer   http
----

With the following commands, it is possible to verify the some functionalities of this quickstart:

[source,sh,options="nowrap"]
----
curl -s $(oc get route client-route --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/client/remote-outbound-stateless | jq .
curl -s $(oc get route client-route --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/client/remote-outbound-stateless | jq .
curl -s $(oc get route client-route --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/client/remote-outbound-notx-stateless | jq .
curl -s $(oc get route client-route --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/client/direct-stateless | jq .
curl -s $(oc get route client-route --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/client/remote-outbound-notx-stateful | jq .
----

For other HTTP endpoints, refer to <<rest-endpoints,the table above>>.

If you like to <<_steps_to_observe_recovery_processing,observe the recovery process>>
then you can follow these shell commands.

[source,sh,options="nowrap"]
----
# To check failure resolution
# verify the number of commits that come from the first and second node of the `server` deployments.
# Two calls are needed, as each reports the commit count of different node.
# Remember the reported number of commits to be compared with the results after crash later.
curl -s $(oc get route server-route --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/server/commits
curl -s $(oc get route server-route --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/server/commits

# Run the remote call that causes the JVM of the server to crash.
curl -s $(oc get route client-route --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/client/remote-outbound-fail-stateless
# The platforms restarts the server back to life.
# The following commands then make us waiting while printing the number of commits happened at the servers.

==== Running on OpenShift: Quickstart application removal

To delete the `client` and the `server` applications, the `WildFlyServer` definitions needs to be deleted.
This is achievable running:

[source,sh,options="nowrap"]
----
oc delete WildFlyServer client;
oc delete WildFlyServer server
----

The `client` and the `server` applications will be stopped, and the two pods will be removed.

To remove the Helm charts installed previously:

[source,sh,options="nowrap"]
----
helm uninstall client;
helm uninstall server;
helm uninstall postgresql
----

Finally, to undeploy and uninstall the {productName}'s operator:

[source,sh,options="nowrap"]
----
cd /tmp/wildfly-operator;
make undeploy;
make uninstall
----

The above commands completely clean the OpenShift namespace
