            <!-- Define the version of JBoss' Java EE 6 APIs we want to use -->
            <!-- JBoss distributes a complete set of Java EE 6 APIs including a Bill
                of Materials (BOM). A BOM specifies the versions of a "stack" (or a collection)
                of artifacts. We use this here so that we always get the correct versions
                of artifacts. Here we use the jboss-javaee-6.0-with-security stack (you can
                read this as the JBoss stack of the Java EE 6 APIs with Security). You can
                actually use this stack with any version of JBoss AS that implements Java
                EE 6, not just JBoss AS 7! -->
