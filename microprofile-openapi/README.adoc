[abstract]
This guide demonstrate how to use the MicroProfile OpenAPI functionality in {productName} to expose an OpenAPI document for a simple REST application.

:standalone-server-type: default
:archiveType: war
:archiveName: {artifactId}

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need:

* less than 15 minutes
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven 3.5.3+

== Steps

. Start a {productName} instance.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn wildfly:run &
----

. Add support for MicroProfile OpenAPI by adding the requisite extension and subsystem.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn wildfly:execute-commands -Dwildfly.commands=/extension=org.wildfly.extension.microprofile.openapi-smallrye:add
$ mvn wildfly:execute-commands -Dwildfly.commands=/subsystem=microprofile-openapi-smallrye:add
----

. Since the MicroProfile OpenAPI subsystem modifies {productName}'s deployment chain, the server needs to be reloaded.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn wildfly:shutdown -Dwildfly.reload=true
----

. Build and deploy the sample application to {productName}.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn wildfly:deploy
----

. Access the OpenAPI documentation of the sample application:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/openapi
----

+
Which should return a YAML document conforming to the http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3[OpenAPI specification]:
+
[source, yaml]

. You can further enhance/complete your OpenAPI documentation by adding https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/annotations[MicroProfile OpenAPI annotations].
  You will need to rebuild/redeploy for those changes to be reflected in the OpenAPI document.

. Optionally, finalize your OpenAPI documentation as described in the <<finalizing-openapi-documentation>> section.

. When you are ready, undeploy the sample application and shutdown the server.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn wildfly:undeploy wildfly:shutdown
----


=== Finalizing OpenAPI documentation

Rather than processing JAX-RS and MicroProfile OpenAPI annotations every time an application is deployed, {productName} can be configured to serve a static OpenAPI document.
When serving a static document, typically, we also want to disable annotation processing.
This is generally suggested for production environments, to ensure an immutable/versioned API contract for integrators.

. Save the generated document to the source tree.  Feel free to use JSON, if you prefer that over YAML.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mkdir src/main/webapp/META-INF
$ curl http://localhost:8080/openapi?format=JSON > src/main/webapp/META-INF/openapi.json
----

. Reconfigure the application to skip annotation scanning when processing the OpenAPI document model.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ echo "mp.openapi.scan.disable=true" > src/main/webapp/META-INF/application.properties
----

. Rebuild and redeploy the modified sample application.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn wildfly:deploy
----

+
The OpenAPI document model will now be built from the static content rather than annotation processing.
