The `websocket-hello` quickstart demonstrates how to create a simple WebSocket application.

== What is it?

The `websocket-hello` quickstart demonstrates how to create a simple WebSocket-enabled application in {productNameFull}. It consists of the following:

* A JavaScript enabled WebSocket HTML client.
* A WebSocket server endpoint that uses annotations to interact with the WebSocket events.
* A `jboss-web.xml` file configured to enable WebSockets

WebSockets are a requirement of the {javaVersion} specification and are implemented in {productName} {productVersion}. They are configured in the `undertow` subsystem of the server configuration file. This quickstart uses the WebSocket default settings, so it is not necessary to modify the server configuration to deploy and run this quickstart.

NOTE: This quickstart demonstrates only a few of the basic functions. A fully functional application should provide better error handling and intercept and handle additional events.

=== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/.

. Click on the *Open Connection* button to create the WebSocket connection and display current status of `Open`.
. Type a name and click *Say Hello* to create and send the `Say hello to __NAME__` message. The message appears in the server log and a response is sent to the client.
. Click on the *Close Connection* button to close the WebSocket connection and display the current status of *Closed*.
. If you attempt to send another message after closing the connection, the following message appears on the page:

----
WebSocket connection is not established. Please click the Open Connection button.
