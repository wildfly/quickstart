    <body>

    	<h1>helloworld-ws Quickstart</h1>
    	<p>
    	  The <i>helloworld-ws</i> quickstart demonstrates the use of a <b>JAX-WS</b> component
            embedded in a simple HelloWorld application.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	 There is no user interface for this quickstart. Instead, you can verify the
         Web Service is running and deployed correctly by accessing the following URL:
         </p>
         <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
         <a href="HelloWorldService?wsdl">HelloWorldService?wsdl</a>
         </div>
         <p>
          This URL will display the WSDL definition for the deployed Web Service endpoint.
    	</p>
    </body>
