<h1>html5-mobile: Mobile Example Using Plain Old HTML5 (POH5)</h1>
<p>Author: Jay Balunas</p>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>This is your project! It's a deployable Maven 3 project to help you
get your foot in the door developing HTML5 based desktop/mobile web applications with Java EE 6
on JBoss. This project is setup to allow you to create a basic Java EE 6 application
using HTML5, jQuery Mobile, JAX-RS, CDI 1.0, EJB 3.1, JPA 2.0 and Bean Validation 1.0. It includes
a persistence unit and some sample persistence and transaction code to help 
you get your feet wet with database access in enterprise Java.</p>
<p>This application is built using a technique called Plain Old HTML5 (POH5).  This uses a pure HTML
client that interacts with with the application server via restful end-points (JAX-RS).  This
application also uses some of the latest HTML5 features and advanced JAX-RS. And since testing
is just as important with POH5 as it is server side core this application also uses QUnit to show
you how to unit test your JavaScript.</p>
<p>What is a modern web application without mobile web support? This application also integrates
jQuery mobile and basic client side device detection to give you both a desktop and mobile 
version of the interface. Both support the same features, including form validation, member
registration, etc. However the mobile version adds in mobile layout, touch, and performance 
improvements needed to get you started with mobile web development on JBoss.<br />
</p>
<h2>System requirements</h2>
<p>All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or better, Maven
3.0 or better.</p>
<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on JBoss AS 7 or JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.</p>
<p>An HTML5 compatible browser such as Chrome 14+, Safari 5+, Firefox 5+, or IE 9+ are
required. and note that some behaviors will vary slightly (ex. validations) based on browser support,
especially IE 9.</p>
<p>Mobile web support is limited to Android and iOS devices.  It should run on HP,
and Black Berry devices as well.  Windows Phone, and others will be supported as 
jQuery Mobile announces support.</p>
<p>With the prerequisites out of the way, you're ready to build and deploy.</p>
<h2>Deploying the application</h2>
<p>First you need to start the JBoss container. To do this, run</p>
<pre><code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
</code></pre>
<p>or if you are using windows</p>
<pre><code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.bat
</code></pre>
<p>Note: Adding "-b 0.0.0.0" to the above commands will allow external clients (phones, tablets, 
desktops, etc...) connect through your local network.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre><code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>To deploy the application, you first need to produce the archive to deploy using
the following Maven goal:</p>
<pre><code>mvn package
</code></pre>
<p>You can now deploy the artifact by executing the following command:</p>
<pre><code>mvn jboss-as:deploy
</code></pre>
<p>This will deploy <code>target/jboss-as-html5-mobile</code>.</p>
<p>The application will be running at the following URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-html5-mobile/">http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-html5-mobile/</a>.</p>
<p>To undeploy run this command:</p>
<pre><code>mvn jboss-as:undeploy
</code></pre>
<p>You can also start the JBoss container and deploy the project using JBoss Tools. See the
<a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Getting+Started+Developing+Applications+Guide" title="Getting Started Developing Applications Guide">Getting Started Developing Applications Guide</a> 
for more information.</p>
<h1>Running the Arquillian tests</h1>
<p>By default, tests are configured to be skipped. The reason is that the sample
test is an Arquillian test, which requires the use of a container. You can
activate this test by selecting one of the container configuration provided 
for JBoss.</p>
<p>To run the test in JBoss, first start the container instance. Then, run the
test goal with the following profile activated:</p>
<pre><code>mvn clean test -Parq-jbossas-remote
</code></pre>
<h1>Running the QUnit tests</h1>
<p>QUnit is a JavaScript unit testing framework used and built by jQuery.This 
application include a set of QUnit tests in order to verify JavaScript that
is core to this HTML5 application.  Executing QUnit test cases is quite easy.
Simply load the following HTML is a browser.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;app-root&gt;/src/test/qunit/index.html
</code></pre>
<p>For more information on QUnit tests see http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit</p>
<h1>Importing the project into an IDE</h1>
<p>If you created the project using the Maven archetype wizard in your IDE
(Eclipse, NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA), then there is nothing to do. You should
already have an IDE project.</p>
<p>Detailed instructions for using Eclipse / JBoss Tools with are provided in the 
<a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Getting+Started+Developing+Applications+Guide" title="Getting Started Developing Applications Guide">Getting Started Developing Applications Guide</a>.</p>
<p>If you created the project from the commandline using archetype:generate, then
you need to import the project into your IDE. If you are using NetBeans 6.8 or
IntelliJ IDEA 9, then all you have to do is open the project as an existing
project. Both of these IDEs recognize Maven projects natively.</p>
<h1>Downloading the sources and Javadocs</h1>
<p>If you want to be able to debug into the source code or look at the Javadocs
of any library in the project, you can run either of the following two
commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect
them.</p>
<pre><code>mvn dependency:sources
mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
</code></pre>
