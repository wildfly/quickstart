== Architecture

ifndef::ProductRelease,EAPXPRelease[]

=== Architecture with Bootable Jar

This backend is built and deployed as Bootable Jar that provisions the {productName} application server and all the feature packs it needs for its features.
The layers are defined in the `pom.xml` file in the `<configuration>` section of the `org.wildfly.plugins:wildfly-jar-maven-plugin` plugin:

[source,xml]
----
<layers>
  <layer>cloud-server</layer>
  <layer>postgresql-datasource</layer>
</layers>
----

The `cloud-server` layer provides everything needed to run the backend on OpenShift. This also includes access to
Jakarta EE APIs such as CDI, JAX-RS, JPA, etc. These two layers comes from the {productName} feature pack provided by the Bootable Jar plugin:

[source,xml]
----
<feature-pack>
  <location>wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe)#${version.server.bootable-jar}</location>
</feature-pack>
----

The `postgresql-datasource` layer provides a JDBC driver and DataSource to connect to a PostgreSQL database. It is not provided
by the {productName} feature pack but by an extra feature pack:

[source,xml]
----
 <feature-pack>
   <groupId>org.wildfly</groupId>
   <artifactId>wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack</artifactId>
   <version>${version.wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack}</version>
 </feature-pack>
----

The Git repository for this feature pack is hosted at https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack.
It provides JDBC drivers and datasources for different databases but for this quickstart, we will only need the `postgresql-datasource`.

endif::[]

=== Architecture with S2I

This backend is built using {productName} S2I Builder and Runtime images. 

ifndef::ProductRelease,EAPXPRelease[]
When the image is built, `org.wildfly.plugins:wildfly-maven-plugin` plugin provisions the {productName} application server and all the feature packs it needs for its features.
The layers are defined in the `pom.xml` file in the `<configuration>` section of the `org.wildfly.plugins:wildfly-maven-plugin` plugin:

[source,xml]

    galleonLayers:
      - cloud-server
      - postgresql-datasource
----
endif::[]

The `cloud-server` layer provides everything needed to run the backend on OpenShift. This also includes access to
Jakarta EE APIs such as CDI, JAX-RS, JPA, etc. These two layers comes from the {productName} feature pack provided in the
{productName} S2I builder image.

ifndef::ProductRelease,EAPXPRelease[]
The `postgresql-datasource` layer provides a JDBC driver and DataSource to connect to a PostgreSQL database. It is also provided by
`org.wildfly:wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack` which is included in the WildFly S2I image.

The Git repository for this feature pack is hosted at https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack.
It provides JDBC drivers and datasources for different databases but for this quickstart, we will only need the `postgresql-datasource`.
endif::[]

ifdef::ProductRelease,EAPXPRelease[]
The `postgresql-datasource` layer provides a JDBC driver and DataSource to connect to a PostgreSQL database. It is also provided by
the `org.jboss.eap:eap-datasources-galleon-pack` feature pack.

It provides JDBC drivers and datasources for different databases but for this quickstart, we will only need the `postgresql-datasource`.
endif::[]


=== Connection to the PostgreSQL database

ifndef::ProductRelease,EAPXPRelease[]
As mentioned, the JDBC drivers and datasource configuration that the backend uses to connect to the PostgreSQL database
is provided by the `org.wildfly:wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack` feature pack.
endif::[]
ifdef::ProductRelease,EAPXPRelease[]
As mentioned, the JDBC drivers and datasource configuration that the backend uses to connect to the PostgreSQL database
is provided by the `org.jboss.eap:eap-datasources-galleon-pack` feature pack.
endif::[]

By default, it exposes a single datasource.
In the backend, the name of this datasource is `ToDos` and is specified in the `persistence.xml` to configure JPA:

[source,xml]
----
<persistence-unit name="primary">
  <jta-data-source>java:jboss/datasources/ToDos</jta-data-source>
</persistence-unit>
----

At runtime, we only need a few environment variables to establish the connection from {productName} to the external PostgreSQL database:

* `POSTGRESQL_DATABASE` - the name of the database (that will be called `todos`)
* `POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST` - the host to connect to the database
* `POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_PORT` - The port to connect to the database
* `POSTGRESQL_USER` & `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` - the credentials to connect to the database
* `POSTGRESQL_DATASOURCE` - The name of the datasources (as mentioned above, it will be `ToDos`)

=== Filters for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

The Web frontend for this quickstart uses JavaScript calls to query the backend's HTTP API.
We must enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) filters in the `undertow` subsystem of {productName} to allow
these HTTP requests to succeed.

ifndef::ProductRelease[]
==== Configuration with Bootable Jar

As we use Bootable Jar to build the application, we provide a CLI script that contains all the commands to
create and configure the CORS filters in Undertow. This script is located in the `src/scripts/cors_filters.cli`.

This script is executed at build time and will provide the following HTTP headers to enabled CORS:

* `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
* `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTION, PUT, DELETE, PATCH`
* `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: accept, authorization, content-type, x-requested-with`
* `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`
* `Access-Control-Max-Age: 1`

By default, the backend accepts requests from any origin (`*`). This is only simplicity. It is possible to restrict
the allowed origin using the environment variable `CORS_ORIGIN` at runtime.
endif::[]

ifdef::ProductRelease[]
==== Configuration with {productName} S2I

As we use S2I to build the application, we need to provide environment variables that will be used to configure the CORS filters in Undertow.

Each filter requires three environment variables (its name, its header key and value) to define them. So to define an
HTTP header such as `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTION, PUT, DELETE, PATCH` we need three environment variables:

* `acam_FILTER_RESPONSE_HEADER_NAME=Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
* `acam_FILTER_RESPONSE_HEADER_VALUE=GET, POST, OPTION, PUT, DELETE, PATCH`
* `acam_FILTER_REF_NAME=Access-Control-Allow-Methods`

We need one more environment variable to specify all the filters we want to enabled. The value is the list
of prefixes we used for each individual filter (such as `acam` in the example above):

* `FILTERS=acao, acam, acah, acac, acma`

== Run the Backend Locally as a Bootable Jar

=== Package the Backend as a Bootable Jar

The backend is packaged as a Bootable Jar and configured to be deployable on OpenShift with the Maven Profile `bootable-jar-openshift`:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package -P bootable-jar-openshift
----

=== Run a Local PostgreSQL Database

Before running the backend locally, we need to have a local PostgreSQL database that we can connect to.
We use the `postgresql` docker image to create one:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ docker run --name todos-db \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=todos \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres
----

This will create a database named `todos-db` that we can connect to on `localhost:5432` with the credentials `todos / mysecretpassword`.

=== Run the Bootable Jar Application

With the PostgreSQL database running, we can start the backend by passing the required environment variables to connect to the database:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=todos \
  POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST=localhost \
  POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_PORT=5432 \
  POSTGRESQL_USER=todos \
  POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  POSTGRESQL_DATASOURCE=ToDos \
  java -jar target/todo-backend-bootable.jar
...
14:41:58,111 INFO  [org.jboss.as.server] (Controller Boot Thread) WFLYSRV0010: Deployed "todo-backend.war" (runtime-name : "ROOT.war")
...
----

The backend is running, and we can use the HTTP API to manage a list of todos:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
# get a list of todos
$ curl http://localhost:8080
[]

# create a todo with the title "This is my first todo item!"
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{"title": "This is my first todo item!"}' http://localhost:8080/
{"completed":false,"id":1,"order":0,"title":"This is my first todo item!","url":"https://localhost:8080/1"}%

# get a list of todos with the one that was just created
$ curl http://localhost:8080
[{"completed":false,"id":1,"order":0,"title":"This is my first todo item!","url":"https://localhost:8080/1"}
----

== Run the Backend Locally

=== Package the Backend

The backend is packaged and deployed on a provisioned server:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package -Pprovisioned-server
----

=== Run a Local PostgreSQL Database

Before running the backend locally, we need to have a local PostgreSQL database that we can connect to.
We use the `postgresql` docker image to create one:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ docker run --name todos-db \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=todos \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres
----

This will create a database named `todos-db` that we can connect to on `localhost:5432` with the credentials `todos / mysecretpassword`.

=== Run the Application

With the PostgreSQL database running, we can start the backend by passing the required environment variables to connect to the database:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ JBOSS_HOME=./target/server \
  POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=todos \
  POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST=localhost \
  POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_PORT=5432 \
  POSTGRESQL_USER=todos \
  POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  POSTGRESQL_DATASOURCE=ToDos \
  ./target/server/bin/standalone.sh
...
14:41:58,111 INFO  [org.jboss.as.server] (Controller Boot Thread) WFLYSRV0010: Deployed "todo-backend.war" (runtime-name : "todo-backend.war")
...
----

The backend is running, and we can use the HTTP API to manage a list of todos:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
# get a list of todos
$ curl http://localhost:8080/todo-backend
[]

# create a todo with the title "This is my first todo item!"
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{"title": "This is my first todo item!"}' http://localhost:8080/todo-backend
{"completed":false,"id":1,"order":0,"title":"This is my first todo item!","url":"https://localhost:8080/todo-backend/1"}%

# get a list of todos with the one that was just created
$ curl http://localhost:8080/todo-backend
[{"completed":false,"id":1,"order":0,"title":"This is my first todo item!","url":"https://localhost:8080/todo-backend/1"}
----
endif::[]

// Run the Arquillian Tests
include::../shared-doc/run-arquillian-functional-tests-remote.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[NOTE]
====
You may also execute those tests against a running bootable jar application, but you will need to add `-Dserver.host=http://localhost:8080` to the command.
====

== Run the Backend on OpenShift

=== Prerequisites

* You must be logged in OpenShift and have an `oc` client to connect to OpenShift
* https://helm.sh[Helm] must be installed to deploy the backend on OpenShift.

Once you have installed Helm, you need to add the repository that provides Helm Charts for {productName} and for postgresql:

----

This will create a PostgreSQL database named `todos` on OpenShift that can be accessed on the port `5432` on the service `todos-db`.
We don't need to copy the credentials to connect to the database as we will retrieve them later using the `todos-db` secret that was created
when the database is deployed.

// Testing on Openshift
include::../shared-doc/run-arquillian-integration-tests-with-openshift.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

=== Environment variables for PostgreSQL

The Helm Chart also contains the environment variables required to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
In local deployment the credentials were passed directly as the values of the environment variables.
For OpenShift, we rely on secrets so that the credentials are never copied outside OpenShift:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
deploy:
  env:
    - name: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          key: database-password
          name: todos-db
----

When the application is deployed, the value for the `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` will be taken from the key `database-password`
in the secret `todos-db`.

Let's wait for the application to be built and deployed:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc get deployment/todo -w
NAME           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
todo   0/3     3            0           31s
...
todo   3/3     3            3           4m31s
----


=== Use the todobackend Web Frontend

Once the backend is deployed on OpenShift, it can be accessed from the route `todo`.
Let's find the host that we can use to connect to this backend:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc get route todo -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}"
todo-jmesnil1-dev.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com
----

This value will be different for every installation of the backend.

[WARNING]
====
Make sure to prepend the host with `https://` to be able to connect to the backend from the ToDo Backend Specs or Client.
The host must also be publicly accessible.
====

We can verify that this application is properly working as a ToDo Backend by running its https://todobackend.com/specs/index.html[specs] on it.


Once all tests passed, we can use the https://todobackend.com/client/index.html[todobackend client] to have a Web application connected to the backend.

[NOTE]
====
https://todobackend.com/[todobackend.com] is an external service used to showcase this quickstart.
It might not always be functional but does not impact the availability of this backend.
====

=== Clean Up

==== Remove the Backend

The backend can be deleted from OpenShift by running the command:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ helm delete todo
release "todo" uninstalled
----

==== Remove the Database

The PostresSQL database can be deleted from OpenShift by running the commands:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc delete all -l template=postgresql-ephemeral-template
replicationcontroller "todos-db-1" deleted
service "todos-db" deleted
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "todos-db" deleted
$ oc delete secret todos-db
secret "todos-db" deleted
----

== Conclusion

This quickstart shows how the datasource feature pack provided by {productName} simplifies the deployment
of a {productName} Jakarta EE backend on OpenShift to connect to an external database and exposes an HTTP API.

ifndef::ProductRelease[]
The use of a Bootable Jar deployment makes it seamless to move from a local deployment for development to a
deployment on OpenShift.
